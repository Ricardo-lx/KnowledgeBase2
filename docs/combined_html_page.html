Midjourney Trademark Policy
Light</p>
<p>Last Updated: August 7, 2023</p>
<p>The goal of this policy is to protect customers by making it easy to readily identify products and services from Midjourney, Inc. Please read on to learn when and how you can properly use our logo, name, and other brand features (collectively, the “Midjourney Trademarks”).</p>
<p>What are the Midjourney Trademarks?</p>
<p>The Midjourney Trademarks include, but are not limited to, the following:</p>
<p>MIDJOURNEY™,
NIJI JOURNEY™,
NIJI·JOURNEY™,
にじジャーニー,
小船,</p>
<p>,</p>
<p>By using any Midjourney Trademarks, or by accessing the Midjourney platform, you acknowledge that Midjourney is the sole owner of the Trademarks and you agree not to interfere with Midjourney’s rights in the Trademarks, including challenging Midjourney’s use, registration of, or application to register such Trademarks. You agree that you will not harm, misuse, or bring into dispute any Midjourney Trademarks. You may not use any Midjourney Trademarks in metatags, search fields, hidden text without Midjourney’s prior written consent. It is never acceptable to use the Midjourney Trademarks in any form that has the purpose or effect of diverting or confusing consumers.</p>
<p>Please review these guidelines on a regular basis, as they may be updated from time to time. Midjourney reserves the right to revoke any permission and to change or restrict any use of the trademarks if we believe that such use is in violation of this policy or is harmful to the reputation of Midjourney or the Midjourney community.</p>
<p>When and How can you use a Midjourney Trademark?</p>
<p>Here is a non-exhaustive list of the correct ways to use a Midjourney Trademark.</p>
<p>Use Midjourney Trademarks to refer to Midjourney, its services, and products truthfully and accurately.</p>
<p>“Created using the Midjourney web app.”</p>
<p>Use Midjourney Trademarks exactly as shown in the list above, including capitalization and proper trademark symbol ™.</p>
<p>Please include this notice when you use the Midjourney’s Trademarks in accordance with this Policy:</p>
<p>“[Midjourney Trademark] is a trademark of Midjourney, Inc. We are not endorsed by or affiliated with Midjourney, Inc.”
Here are some ways you shouldn’t use our marks:
Do not use Midjourney Trademarks in the name of your business, product, service, app, publication, domain name, or other offering.
Do not use Midjourney wordmarks in plural or possessive forms.
Do not misspell the Midjourney Marks (including hyphens, spaces etc.)
Do not use marks, logos, company names, domain names, social media names, community names, or designs that are confusingly similar to Midjourney’s Trademarks. Deliberate misspellings and transliterations of the Midjourney Trademarks are also not permitted
Ex. Midj0urney
Do not use Midjourney’s Trademarks to incorrectly imply sponsorship, endorsement, or affiliation with Midjourney.
Do not use Midjourney’s Trademarks for any illegal, misleading, derogatory, or defamatory purposes.
Do not use Midjourney’s Trademarks more prominently than your company name, product, or service.
Do not use Midjourney’s Trademarks on merchandise for sale.
Do not use Midjourney’s Trademarks for any other form of commercial use, unless limited to a truthful descriptive reference.
Do not modify, distort, abbreviate, or combine Midjourney’s Trademarks with any other symbols, words, images, or slogans.</p>
<p>Can I use one of the Midjourney Trademarks when registering a domain name?</p>
<p>You may not use the Midjourney Trademarks in your own domain, if that use would likely confuse a relevant consumer. You may not use the Midjourney Trademarks in your product, app, or service, except to clearly refer to Midjourney services in a nominative fashion.</p>
<p>Can I use one of the Midjourney Trademarks when naming an application or game?</p>
<p>You may not use the Midjourney trademark in naming an application or a game, if that use would likely confuse a consumer.</p>
<p>What if I want to plan an online or in person event concerning Midjourney or with Midjourney community members?</p>
<p>To help guide your usage of our trademarks, please keep in mind the following: Meetups, events, online chats outside our Discord channel, or other in person or online events that are not sponsored or endorsed by Midjourney cannot misrepresent the event as such. In order to avoid this confusion, the event planner should promote the event as an unofficial event.</p>
<p>Midjourney is not responsible for your experience at these unofficial events, as it is not an official Midjourney event. In order to avoid any implication that Midjourney is associated or sponsoring the event, avoid prominent use the Midjourney Trademarks (e.g., in connection with the title of the event etc.) to advertise, promote, or otherwise talk about the event.</p>
<p>IMPORTANT NOTE: Nothing in this Midjourney policy statement shall be interpreted to allow any third parties to claim any association with the Midjourney offerings or to imply its approval or support by Midjourney for any third-party products or services.</p>
<p>If you have any questions at all about proper usage of the Midjourney Trademarks, please contact trademarks@midjourney.com</p>

<p>Europe
If You are located in the European Economic Area (the “EEA”), Switzerland, or the United Kingdom (the “UK”) Our legal basis for collecting and using the Personal Data described in this Policy will depend on the personal data concerned and the specific context in which we collect it. However, we will normally collect personal data from you only where we have your consent to do so, where we need the personal data to perform a contract with you, or where the processing is in our legitimate interests and not overridden by your data protection interests or fundamental rights and freedoms. In some cases, we may also have a legal obligation to collect personal data from you.</p>
<p>Midjourney may share information internally or with third parties, as further described in this Policy. When we share Personal Data of individuals in the EEA, Switzerland or UK with third parties, we make use of a variety of legal mechanisms to safeguard the transfer including the European Commission-approved standard contractual clauses, as well as additional safeguards where appropriate.</p>
<p>Additionally You have the following data protection rights:</p>
<p>You can request access, correction, updates or deletion of your Personal Data.
You can object to our processing of your Personal Data, ask us to restrict processing of your Personal Data or request portability of your Personal Data.
If we have collected and processed your Personal Data with your consent, then you can withdraw your consent at any time. Withdrawing your consent will not affect the lawfulness of any processing we conducted prior to your withdrawal, nor will it affect processing of your Personal Data conducted in reliance on lawful processing grounds other than consent.
You have the right to complain to a data protection authority about our collection and use of your Personal Data.</p>
<p>In order to exercise Your rights please contact privacy@midjourney.com.</p>

<p>YOUR RIGHTS AND CHOICES
The CCPA provides individuals residing in California or whose Personal Information was collected in California with specific rights regarding their Personal information. The below describes your rights and how you may exercise them.</p>
<p>Access to Specific Information and Data Portability Rights

<p>Deletion Request Rights
You have the right to request that Midjourney delete any of your Personal Information that we collected from you and/or retained. Unless subject to a certain limited exception, once Midjourney receives and confirms your verifiable data deletion request, we will delete (and direct our service providers to delete) your personal information from our records.

<p>Do Not Sell Opt-Out Rights
You have the right to opt-out of any sales, as defined by the CCPA, of Personal Information by Midjourney. However, Midjourney does not sell your information.</p>
<p>EXERCISING YOUR RIGHTS
To exercise your access, data portability, and deletion or do not sell opt-out rights described above, you may submit a verifiable consumer request by any of the following means: By email to privacy@midjourney.com.</p>
<p>You may only make a verifiable consumer request for access or data portability up to two times within a 12-month period. You may make a verifiable do not sell opt-out request at any time. Any such request must: (i) provide sufficient information that allows Us to reasonably verify that you are the person about whom we collected personal information or an authorized representative thereof; and (ii) describe your request with sufficient detail such that we may understand, evaluate, and respond to it. Midjourney cannot respond to your request or provide you with personal information if we cannot verify your identity or authority to make the request and confirm the personal information relates to you. Making a verifiable consumer request does not require you to create an account with Midjourney. Midjourney will only use personal information provided in a verifiable consumer request to verify the requestor’s identity or authority to make the request. Only you or a person registered with the California Secretary of State that you authorize to act on your behalf may make a verifiable consumer request related to your Personal Information. You may also make a verifiable consumer request on behalf of your minor child.</p>

Any disclosures we provide will only cover the 12-month period preceding the verifiable consumer request’s receipt. If applicable, the response we provide will also explain any reasons we cannot comply with a request. For data portability requests, Midjourney will provide your personal information in a format that is readily usable and transferable. Midjourney does not charge a fee to process or respond to your verifiable consumer request unless such requests become excessive, repetitive, or manifestly unfounded or as otherwise permitted by the CCPA. If we determine that a request warrants charging a fee, we will notify you and provide you with a cost estimate before completing your request.</p>

Terms of Service
Light</p>
<p>Version Effective Date: December 22, 2023</p>
<p>Thank you for using the Midjourney platform (the “Services”). These Terms of Service (the “Agreement”) explain what rights you have with respect to images and other assets which you might generate with the Service, or prompts you might enter into the Service (the “Assets”), your use of the Services, and other important topics like arbitration. Please read it carefully. Our privacy policy outlines how we handle your data here.</p>
<p>This Agreement is entered into by Midjourney Inc. and the entity or person agreeing to these terms (the &quot;Customer,&quot; “You” or “Your”) and govern the Customer's access to and use of the Services.</p>
<p>This Agreement is effective when the Customer is presented with this Agreement and proceeds to use the Services (the &quot;Effective Date&quot;) or to receive or distribute Assets. These terms may be updated and presented again to the Customer from time to time. Continued use of the Services constitutes acceptance of the updated terms. If You do not agree to this Agreement, please stop using the Services.</p>
<p>Other documents referenced here may also bind Customer’s use of the Services, including the Subscription Plans page and the Community Guidelines below.</p>
<ol>
<li>Service Availability and Quality</li>
</ol>
<p>We are constantly improving the Services to make them better. The Services are subject to modification and change, including but not limited to the art style of Assets, the algorithms used to generate the Assets, and features available to the Customer. No guarantees are made with respect to the Services’ quality, stability, uptime or reliability. Please do not create any dependencies on any attributes of the Services or the Assets. We will not be liable to You or Your downstream customers for any harm caused by Your dependency on the Service.</p>
<p>Both the Services and the Assets are provided to Customer on an &quot;AS IS&quot; BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the appropriateness of using or redistributing the Assets and assume any risks associated with use of the Services.</p>
<p>Midjourney reserves the right to suspend or ban Your access to the Services at any time, and for any reason. You may not use the Services for purposes of developing or offering competitive products or services. You may not reverse engineer the Services or the Assets. You may not use automated tools to access, interact with, or generate Assets through the Services. You may not resell or redistribute the Services or access to the Service. Only one user may use the Services per registered account. Each user of the Services may only have one account.</p>
<p>You may not use the Service to try to violate the intellectual property rights of others, including copyright, patent, or trademark rights. Doing so may subject you to penalties including legal action or a permanent ban from the Service.</p>
<p>We reserve the right to investigate complaints or reported violations of our Terms of Service and to take any action we deem appropriate including but not limited to reporting any suspected unlawful activity to law enforcement officials, regulators, or other third parties and disclosing any information necessary or appropriate to such persons or entities relating to user profiles, e-mail addresses, usage history, posted materials, IP addresses and traffic information.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>Age Requirements</li>
</ol>
<p>By accessing the Services, You confirm that You are at least 13 years old and meet the minimum age of digital consent in Your country. If You are old enough to access the Services in Your country, but not old enough to have authority to consent to our terms, Your parent or guardian must agree to our terms on Your behalf.</p>
<p>Please ask Your parent or guardian to read these terms with You. If You are a parent or legal guardian, and You allow Your teenager to use the Services, then these terms also apply to You and You are responsible for Your teenager’s activity on the Services.</p>
<p>Midjourney tries to make its Services PG-13 and family friendly, but the Assets are generated by an artificial intelligence system based on user queries. This is new technology and it does not always work as expected. No guarantees are made as to the suitability of the Assets for the Customer.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>Your Information</li>
</ol>
<p>By using the Services, You may provide Midjourney with personal information like Your email address, user name, billing information, favorites, image outputs, and text prompts that You enter, or sample images that You upload to the Service. Our privacy policy can be found here.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>Content Rights
Your Rights</li>
</ol>
<p>You own all Assets You create with the Services to the fullest extent possible under applicable law. There are some exceptions:</p>
<p>Your ownership is subject to any obligations imposed by this Agreement and the rights of any third-parties.
If you are a company or any employee of a company with more than $1,000,000 USD a year in revenue, you must be subscribed to a “Pro” or “Mega” plan to own Your Assets.
If you upscale the images of others, these images remain owned by the original creators.</p>
<p>Please consult Your own lawyer if You want more information about the state of current intellectual property law in Your jurisdiction. Your ownership of the Assets you created persists even if in subsequent months You downgrade or cancel Your membership.</p>
<p>Rights You give to Midjourney</p>
<p>By using the Services, You grant to Midjourney, its successors, and assigns a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, sublicensable no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable copyright license to reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute text and image prompts You input into the Services, as well as any Assets produced by You through the Service. This license survives termination of this Agreement by any party, for any reason.</p>
<p>Remixing and Stealth Mode</p>
<p>Please note: Midjourney is an open community which allows others to use and remix Your images and prompts whenever they are posted in a public setting. By default, Your images are publically viewable and remixable. As described below, You grant Midjourney a license to allow this.</p>
<p>If You purchased the Stealth feature as part of Your “Pro” or &quot;Mega&quot; subscription or through the previously available add-on, we agree to make best efforts not to publish any Assets You make in any situation where you have engaged stealth mode in the Services.</p>
<p>Please be aware that any image You make in a shared or open space, such as a Discord chatroom, is viewable by anyone in that chatroom, regardless of whether Stealth mode is engaged.</p>
<ol start="5">

6. Dispute Resolution and Governing Law</p>
<p>In the event a dispute, controversy, or claim arises out of or relating to these Terms (“Dispute”), the Dispute will be resolved by binding arbitration rather than in court. The parties will first try in good faith to settle any Dispute within 30 days after the Dispute arises. If the Dispute is not resolved within 30 days, it shall be resolved by arbitration by the American Arbitration Association’s International Centre for Dispute Resolution in accordance with its Expedited Commercial Rules in force as of the date of this Agreement (&quot;Rules&quot;). The parties will mutually select one arbitrator. The arbitration will be conducted in English in Santa Clara County, California, USA. Either party may apply to any competent court for injunctive relief necessary to protect its rights pending resolution of the arbitration. The arbitrator may order equitable or injunctive relief consistent with the remedies and limitations in the Agreement. The arbitral award will be final and binding on the parties and its execution may be presented in any competent court, including any court with jurisdiction over either party or any of its property.
Each party will bear its own lawyers’ and experts’ fees and expenses, regardless of the arbitrator’s final decision regarding the Dispute.</p>
<ol start="7">
<li>Unlimited Service and Rate Limiting</li>
</ol>
<p>If You purchase an unlimited plan, we will try to reasonably offer You unlimited access to the Services. However, we reserve the right to rate limit You to prevent quality decay or interruptions to other customers.</p>
<ol start="8">
<li>Payment and Billing</li>
</ol>
<p>We may invoice You for Your use of the Services through a third party payment service provider. The third party service provider’s terms of service shall govern and supersede this Agreement in case of conflict.</p>
<p>You are free to cancel Your plan at any time. We also reserve the right to terminate Your access to the Service for any reason, including for violation of the Community Guidelines or other inappropriate use of the Service. Any violation of Community Guidelines is a breach of this Agreement. You will not be refunded for the current subscription period, but You will not be charged after the current subscription period has ended. Additional information and policies regarding our subscription plans, including details on billing, taxes, refunds, and authorization, can be found here.</p>
<ol start="9">
<li>Community Guidelines
Be kind and respect each other and staff. Do not create images or use text prompts that are inherently disrespectful, aggressive, hateful, or otherwise abusive. Violence or harassment of any kind will not be tolerated.
No adult content or gore. Please avoid making visually shocking or disturbing content. We will block some text inputs automatically.
Respect others’ creations. Do not distribute or publicly repost the creations of others without their permission.
You may not use the Services to generate images for political campaigns, or to try to influence the outcome of an election.
You may not use the Services or the Assets to attempt to or to actually deceive or defraud anyone.
You may not use the Services for illegal activity nor may you upload images to our servers that involve illegal activity, or where the uploading itself may be illegal.

Respect others’ rights. Do not upload others’ private information.
Be careful about sharing. It’s OK to share Your creations outside of the Midjourney community but please consider how others might view Your content.
Banhammer. Any violations of these rules may lead to bans from our services. We are not a democracy. Behave respectfully or lose Your rights to use the Service.</li>
<li>Limitation of Liability and Indemnity</li>
</ol>
<p>We provide the service as is, and we make no promises or guarantees about it.</p>
<p>You understand and agree that we will not be liable to You or any third party for any loss of profits, use, goodwill, or data, or for any incidental, indirect, special, consequential or exemplary damages, however they arise.</p>
<p>You are responsible for Your use of the service. If You harm someone else or get into a dispute with someone else, we will not be involved.</p>
<p>If You knowingly infringe someone else’s intellectual property, and that costs us money, we’re going to come find You and collect that money from You. We might also do other stuff, like try to get a court to make You pay our legal fees. Don’t do it.</p>
<ol start="11">
<li>Miscellaneous
Force Majeure. Neither party will be liable for failure or delay in performance to the extent caused by circumstances beyond its reasonable control, including acts of God, natural disasters, terrorism, riots, or war.
No Agency. This Agreement does not create any agency, partnership, or joint venture between the parties.
Severability. If any part of this Agreement is invalid, illegal, or unenforceable, the rest of the Agreement will remain in effect.
No Third-Party Beneficiaries. This Agreement does not confer any benefits on any third party unless it expressly states that it does.
Survival. The sections and obligations in this Agreement that a reasonable person would expect to survive this agreement, will. Particularly the IP and privacy stuff.
Governing Law. These Terms shall be governed by the laws of the State of California, USA, without reference to conflict of law rules. All disputes will be governed by the arbitration agreement above.

Midjourney uses powerful Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) to interpret and process each prompt. When you purchase a subscription to Midjourney, you are purchasing time on these GPUs.</p>
<p>Different subscription plans have different amounts of monthly GPU time.
This monthly subscription GPU time is Fast Mode time. Fast Mode tries to give you access to a GPU instantly. It's the default processing tier and uses your subscription's monthly GPU time.</p>
<p>How many GPU minutes do my generations cost?</p>
<p>The Average Job the Midjourney bot processes takes about one minute of GPU time to finish creating an image. Upscaling an image, using nonstandard aspect ratios, or older Midjourney Model Versions may take more time. Creating variations or using lower quality values will take less time.</p>
<p>A Job's time depends on the following factors:</p>
<pre><code>+ Lower Time	++ Average Time	+++ Higher Time
</code></pre>
<p>Job Type	Variations	/imagine	Upscale
Aspect Ratio	default (square)	tall or wide	
Quality Parameter	--q 0.25 or --q 0.5	default (--q 1)	--q 2 (for legacy Model Versions
Stop Parameter	--stop 10–--stop 99	default (--stop 100)	</p>
<p>Use /info before and after running a process to see how many of your remaining GPU minutes the generation used.</p>
<p>Fast vs. Relax Mode</p>
<p>Subscribers to the Standard, Pro, and Mega plans can create an unlimited number of images each month in Relax Mode. Relax Mode will not cost any GPU time, but Jobs will be placed into a queue based on how much you've used the system.</p>
<p>How long do I need to wait in Relax mode?</p>
<p>Jobs in Relax mode are placed in a queue to be processed as GPUs become available. Wait times for Relax are dynamic but generally range between 0–10 minutes per job. If you use Relax mode occasionally, you will have shorter wait times compared to subscribers that have used it more. This priority currently resets whenever you renew your monthly subscription.</p>
<p>Limitations</p>
<p>Permutation prompts, the --repeat parameter and the Legacy upscaler, Max Upscale are not available while useing Relax mode.</p>
<p>Run Out of Fast Time?</p>
<p>You can purchase more Fast Hours on your Midjourney.com/accounts page.</p>
<p>By default, images are generated using Fast Mode.
Unused monthly Fast GPU time does not roll over.
Fast Mode is automatically reactivated when the subscription renews.</p>
<p>Turbo Mode</p>
<p>Turbo Mode is available for subscribers who want extremely quick image generation. Turbo mode uses a high-speed experimental GPU pool. Jobs run in Turbo mode generate up to four times faster but consume twice as many subscription GPU minutes as a typical Fast Mode Job.</p>
<p>Turbo mode is only available with Midjourney Model Versions 5, 5.1, and 5.2.</p>
<p>If Turbo mode is selected, but the GPUs are unavailable, or it is incompatible with the selected model version, your job will run in Fast Mode instead.</p>
<p>Turbo Mode is an experimental feature, and availability and price may change at any time.</p>
<p>How to Switch Between Modes
Use the /fast /turbo or /relax command</p>
<p>Standard, Pro, and Mega plan subscribers can use the /fast or /relax commands to switch between modes.</p>
<p>Use the Settings Command</p>
<p>Use the /settings command and choose 🐢 Relax 🐇 Fast or ⚡ Turbo from the menu.</p>
<p>Use the --fast --turbo or --relax parameter</p>
<p>Standard, Pro, and Mega plan subscribers can use the --relax, --fast, or --turbo parameters at the end of a prompt to run a single job using Relax, Fast, or Turbo mode instead of changing their preferred setting.</p>

The Midjourney bot uses a seed number to create a field of visual noise, like television static, as a starting point to generate the initial image grids. Seed numbers are generated randomly for each image but can be specified with the --seed parameter. If you use the same seed number and prompt, you will get similar final images.
--seed accepts whole numbers 0–4294967295.
--seed values only influence the initial image grid.
Identical --seed values using Model Versions 1, 2, 3, test, and testp will produce images with similar composition, color, and details.
Identical --seed values using Model Versions 4, 5, and niji will produce nearly identical images.
Seed numbers are not static and should not be relied upon between sessions.
Seed Parameter</p>
<p>If no Seed is specified, Midjourney will use a randomly generated seed number, producing a wide variety of options each time a prompt is used.</p>
<p>Jobs run three times with random seeds:</p>
<p>prompt example: /imagine prompt celadon owl pitcher</p>
<p>Jobs run two times with --seed 123:</p>
<p>prompt example: /imagine prompt celadon owl pitcher --seed 123</p>
<p>How to Find a Job's Seed Number
Use a Discord Emoji Reaction</p>
<p>Find the seed number of a Job in discord by reacting with an ✉️ envelope emoji to a Job.</p>
<p>Use The Show Command to Bring Back Old Jobs</p>
<p>To get the seed number for a past image, copy the job ID and use the /show &lt;Job ID #&gt; command with that ID to revive the Job. You can then react to the newly regenerated Job with an ✉️ envelope emoji.</p>
<p>How To Change Seed Numbers
Use the --seed Parameter</p>
<p>Add --seed <value> to the end of your prompt.</p>

Permutation Prompts
Light
Permutation Prompts allow you to quickly generate variations of a Prompt with a single /imagine command. By including lists of options separated with commas , within curly braces {} in your prompt, you can create multiple versions of a prompt with different combinations of those options.</p>
<p>Basic Subscribers can create a maximum of 4 Jobs with a single Permutation Prompt.
Standard Subscribers can create a maximum of 10 Jobs with a single Permutation Prompt.
Pro and Mega Subscribers can create a maximum of 40 Jobs with a single Permutation Prompt.</p>
<p>You can use Permutation Prompts to create combinations and permutations involving any part of a Midjourney Prompt, including text, image prompts, parameters, or prompt weights.
Permutation prompts are only available while using Fast mode.</p>
<p>Permutation Prompt Basics</p>
<p>Separate your list of options within curly brackets {} to quickly create and process multiple prompt variations.</p>
<p>Prompt Example:
/imagine prompt a {red, green, yellow} bird creates and processes three Jobs.</p>
<p>/imagine prompt a red bird
/imagine prompt a green bird
/imagine prompt a yellow bird</p>
<p>GPU Minutes</p>
<p>The Midjourney Bot processes each Permutation Prompt variation as an individual Job. Each Job consumes GPU minutes.</p>
<p>Permutation Prompts will show a confirmation message before they begin processing.</p>
<p>Permutation Prompt Examples
Prompt Text Variations</p>
<p>The prompt /imagine prompt a naturalist illustration of a {pineapple, blueberry, rambutan, banana} bird will create and process four Jobs:</p>
<p>a naturalist illustration of a pineapple bird</p>
<p>a naturalist illustration of a blueberry bird</p>
<p>a naturalist illustration of a rambutan bird</p>
<p>a naturalist illustration of a banana bird</p>
<p>Prompt Parameter Variations</p>
<p>The prompt /imagine prompt a naturalist illustration of a fruit salad bird --ar {3:2, 1:1, 2:3, 1:2} will create and process four Jobs with different aspect ratios:</p>
<p>a naturalist illustration of a fruit salad bird --ar 3:2</p>
<p>a naturalist illustration of a fruit salad bird --ar 1:1</p>
<p>a naturalist illustration of a fruit salad bird --ar 2:3</p>
<p>a naturalist illustration of a fruit salad bird --ar 1:2</p>
<p>The prompt /imagine prompt a naturalist illustration of a fruit salad bird --{v 5, niji, test} will create and process three Jobs using different Midjourney Model Versions:</p>
<p>a naturalist illustration of a fruit salad bird --v 5</p>
<p>a naturalist illustration of a fruit salad bird --niji</p>
<p>a naturalist illustration of a fruit salad bird --test</p>
<p>Multiple and Nested Permutations</p>
<p>It is possible to use multiple sets of bracketed options in a single prompt.
/imagine prompt a {red, green} bird in the {jungle, desert} creates and processes four Jobs.</p>
<p>/imagine prompt a red bird in the jungle
/imagine prompt a red bird in the desert
/imagine prompt a green bird in the jungle
/imagine prompt a green bird in the desert</p>
<p>It is also possible to nest sets of bracketed options inside other sets of brackets within a single prompt:</p>
<p>Example: /imagine prompt A {sculpture, painting} of a {seagull {on a pier, on a beach}, poodle {on a sofa, in a truck}}.</p>
<p>/imagine prompt A sculpture of a seagull on a pier.
/imagine prompt A sculpture of a seagull on a beach.
/imagine prompt A sculpture of a poodle on a sofa.
/imagine prompt A sculpture of a poodle in a truck.
/imagine prompt A painting of a seagull on a pier.
/imagine prompt A painting of a seagull on a beach.
/imagine prompt A painting of a poodle on a sofa.
/imagine prompt A painting of a poodle in a truck.</p>
<p>Escape Character</p>
<p>If you want to include a , within the curly brackets that does not act as a separator place a backslash \ directly before it.</p>
<p>imagine prompt {red, pastel, yellow} bird produces three Jobs
/imagine prompt a red bird
/imagine prompt a pastel bird
/imagine prompt a yellow bird</p>
<p>imagine prompt {red, pastel , yellow} bird produces two Jobs
/imagine prompt a red bird
/imagine prompt a pastel, yellow bird</p>

Zoom Out
Light
The Zoom Out option allows you to extend the canvas of an upscaled image beyond its original boundaries without changing the content of the original image. The newly expanded canvas will be filled-in using guidance from the prompt and the original image.</p>
<p>Zoom Out does not increase the maximum 1024px x 1024 px size of an image.</p>
<p>Zoom Out</p>
<p>🔎 Zoom Out 2X 🔎 Zoom Out 1.5X buttons will appear after upscaling an image.</p>
<p>Prompt: vibrant California poppies</p>
<p>Starting Image
Zoom Out 1.5X
Zoom Out 2X</p>
<p>Make Square</p>
<p>With Make Square you can adjust the aspect ratio of a non-square image to make it square. If the original aspect ratio is wide (landscape), it will be expanded vertically. If it is tall (portrait), it will be expanded horizontally. The emoji ↔️ ↕️ next to the ↔️ Make Square button also indicates which way the image will be expanded. The ↔️ Make Square button will appear underneath non-square upscaled images.</p>
<p>Prompt: vibrant California poppies</p>
<p>Starting Image 
↕️ Make Square

↔️ Make Square </p>
<p>Custom Zoom</p>
<p>The 🔎 Custom Zoom button lets you choose how much to zoom out on an image. 🔎 Custom Zoom button under an upscaled image will pop up a dialogue box where you enter a custom value for --zoom. --zoom accepts values between 1-2.</p>
<p>Change the Aspect Ratio of an Upscaled Image</p>
<p>You can use --zoom 1 in this Custom Zoom pop-up box to change the aspect ratio, with the --ar parameter, without zooming out.</p>
<p>Change Your Prompt with Custom Zoom</p>
<p>🔎 Custom Zoom allows you to change the prompt before you expand your image, giving you finer control over the finished image. For example, changing the prompt to &quot;A framed picture on the wall&quot; gives this result:</p>
<p>Starting Image</p>
<p>prompt: vibrant California poppies</p>
<p>Custom Zoom + Changed Prompt</p>
<p>Zoom Out prompt: A framed picture on the wall --zoom 2</p>

Aspect Ratios
Light
The --aspect or --ar parameter changes the aspect ratio of the generated image. An aspect ratio is the width-to-height ratio of an image. It is typically expressed as two numbers separated by a colon, such as 7:4 or 4:3.</p>
<p>A square image has equal width and height, described as a 1:1 aspect ratio. The image could be 1000px × 1000px, or 1500px × 1500px, and the aspect ratio would still be 1:1. A computer screen might have a ratio of 16:10. The width is 1.6 times longer than the height. So the image could be 1600px × 1000px, 4000px × 2000px, 320px x 200px, etc.</p>
<p>The default aspect ratio is 1:1.
--aspect must use whole numbers. Use 139:100 instead of 1.39:1.
The aspect ratio impacts the shape and composition of a generated image.
Some aspect ratios may be slightly changed when upscaling.</p>
<p>Max Aspect Ratios</p>
<p>Different Midjourney Version Models have different maximum aspect ratios.</p>
<pre><code>Version 5	Version 4	niji 5
</code></pre>
<p>Ratios	any*	1:2 to 2:1	any*</p>
<p>The --ar parameter will accept any aspect ratio from 1:1 (square) up to the maximum aspect ratio for each model. However, final outputs may be slightly modified during image generation or upscaling.</p>
<ul>
<li>Aspect ratios greater than 2:1 are experimental and may produce unpredicatble results.</li>
</ul>
<p>prompt example: imagine/ prompt vibrant california poppies --ar 5:4</p>
<p>Common Midjourney Aspect Ratios</p>
<p>--aspect 1:1 Default aspect ratio.
--aspect 5:4 Common frame and print ratio.
--aspect 3:2 Common in print photography.
--aspect 7:4 Close to HD TV screens and smartphone screens.</p>
<p>Changing the Aspect Ratio of an Image</p>
<p>Do you love an image you have generated but wish it taller or wider? You can use the 🔎 Zoom Out buttons on any upscaled image to change the aspect ratio of your image. The Midjourney Bot will fill in the new space with additional content informed by your prompt and the original image.</p>
<p>How to Set the Aspect Ratio
Use Aspect Ratio Parameters</p>
<p>Add --aspect <value>:<value>, or --ar <value>:<value> to the end of your prompt.</p>

Understanding Image Size
Light
There are lots of terms for how &quot;big&quot; an image is. Many people use words like resolution, file size, pixel count, dots per inch, and high resolution interchangeably. Understanding what these words mean can help you get the results you want from Midjourney images.</p>
<p>This guide is a simplified, non-technical explanation of image size, dimensions, resolutions, and DPI.</p>
<p>Image Size Basics</p>
<p>Examples will use this simple sailboat picture.</p>
<p>What is an image file?</p>
<p>Image files like .jpg, .png, or .gif are instructions for creating an image.
Each image is a mosaic of small colored tiles (pixels) that form the picture.</p>
<p>Think about image files as a set of instructions on how to arrange colored pixels to create an image.</p>
<p>What is File Size?</p>
<p>The file size is directly related to the amount of information inside the file. In the boat picture, the file contains 10 rows and 10 columns, or 100 pieces of information. If each colored dot is one byte of information, the image file would be 100 bytes.</p>
<p>If the file has a grid of 200 x 400 pieces of color information, it would be an 80,000-byte file (200*400=80,000) or 80,000-byte/1000 = 80-kilobyte file.</p>
<p>Image Dimensions</p>
<p>People generally don't talk about the file size of an image in kilobytes or megabytes. They talk about the image's dimensions (the number of columns and rows information) The boat.jpg example above is a 10x10 pixel image. 1024x1024, 720p, and 4K are all shorthand ways of talking about the pixel dimensions of an image.
​
There are no &quot;high-resolution&quot; image files when working on monitors, phones, TVs, or other screens. The only thing that matters is how much information you have (the image dimensions) vs. the size of the display.
The boat.jpg image might be a great size on a vintage flip phone, fine on your tablet, and not enough for your brand-new monitor.</p>
<p>The same image dimension viewed on different screens.</p>
<p>DPI Dots Per Inch</p>
<p>Dots Per Inch, Pixels Per Inch, Dots Per Centimeter, and Points Per Inch all refer to generally the same concept. The amount of information in a given length. 300 &quot;dots&quot; per inch means there are 300 pieces of color information (pixels, printed CMYK dots, etc.) in each inch.
DPI is NOT a measurement that is useful on screens. The dimensions of the file are what matters on screen. DPI is VERY important when printing. The general standard for a great-looking print is 300 dots of color in every inch. 300DPI is the point where the individual dots are so closely packed together you can't distinguish individual dots, and the picture looks smooth and crisp.</p>
<p>What DPI is this file?</p>
<p>It depends! Knowing that your file only contains instructions on how to make an image, the DPI is only determined when you tell the printer how closely or loosely that information is packed together.
Think about building the file with Legos. You can take the same set of instructions, and if you have a pile of small 1x1 bricks, you pack your information into a smaller space than if you start with a pile of 2x2 bricks.</p>
<p>The same &quot;file instructions&quot; using two sizes of tiles.</p>
<p>A Simplified Example of the Math</p>
<p>For this example, you have a 1200x1200 pixel image. What DPI is that image? It depends on how large you want it to print out.
1200/300 = 4. A 1200x1200 pixel image would produce a great looking 4in x 4in image.
1200/150 = 8. A 1200x1200 pixel image would produce an OK-looking 8in x 8in image.
1200/100 = 12. A 1200x1200 pixel image would produce a pretty bad looking 12in x 12in image.</p>
<p>Midjourney Image Sizes</p>
<p>The default size of a Midjourney image using the current default Model Version is 1024 x 1024 pixels. You can use the upscale tool, to increase the file size to 2048 x 2048 or 4096 x 4096 pixels. Using other aspect ratios will produce images with different dimensions but the same general file size.</p>
<p>Open your Midjourney images in your web browser or download them from Midjourney.com for maximum file size.</p>
<p>Can You Print a Midjourney Image?</p>
<p>Absolutely! The quality of your print simply follows the above rules of DPI. If you want a quality print, you need 300 pieces of information in every inch. So the default 1024x1024 pixel midjourney image would produce a good quality 3.4 in x 3.4 in print (1024 / 300 = 3.41). An image that has been upscaled to 4096x4096 pixels would produce a good quality 13.7 in x 13.7 in print (4096 / 300 = 13.65)</p>

Weird
Light
Explore unconventional aesthetics with the experimental --weird or --w parameter. This parameter introduces quirky and offbeat qualities to your generated images, resulting in unique and unexpected outcomes.</p>
<p>--weird accepts values: 0–3000.
The default --weird value is 0.
--weird is a highly experimental feature. What's weird may change over time
--weird is compatible with Midjourney Model Versions 5, 5.1, 5.2 and niji 5
--weird is not fully compatible with seeds</p>
<p>The Influence of Weird on Jobs</p>
<p>The optimal --weird value is dependent on the prompt and requires experimentation. Try starting with smaller values, such as 250 or 500, and then go up/down from there. If you want a generation to be conventionally attractive and weird, try mixing higher --stylize values with --weird. Try starting with similar values for both. Example /imagine prompt cyanotype cat --stylize 250 --weird 250.</p>
<p>prompt example: /imagine prompt cyanotype cat --weird 250</p>
<p>--weird 0
--weird 250
--weird 500
--weird 1000</p>
<p>prompt example: /imagine prompt lithograph potato --weird 250</p>
<p>--weird 0
--weird 250
--weird 500
--weird 1000</p>
<p>prompt example: /imagine prompt clockwork chicken --weird 250</p>
<p>--weird 0
--weird 250
--weird 500
--weird 1000</p>
<p>What's the difference between --weird, --chaos, and --stylize?</p>
<p>--chaos controls how diverse the initial grid images are from each other.
--stylize controls how strongly Midjourney's default aesthetic is applied.
--weird controls how unusual an image is compared to previous Midjourney images.</p>
<p>How to Use the Weird Parameter</p>
<p>Add --weird <value> or --w <value> to the end of your prompt.</p>

The current Midjourney and Niji Model Versions produce grids of 1024 x 1024 pixel images. Use the U1 U2 U3 U4 buttons under each image grid to separate your selected image. You can then use the Upscale (2x) or Upscale (4x) tools to increase the size of your image.</p>
<p>Upscale tools use your subscription's GPU minutes. Using Upscale 2X on an image takes roughly twice as long as generating an initial image grid. Using Upscale 4X on an image takes roughly six times as long as generating an initial image grid.</p>
<p>Upscale tools are not compatible with the pan tool or the tile parameter.</p>
<p>How to Use the Upscale Tools</p>
<ol>
<li>Generate an Image</li>
</ol>
<p>Create an image using the /imagine command.</p>

The --chaos or --c parameter influences how varied the initial image grids are. High --chaos values will produce more unusual and unexpected results and compositions. Lower --chaos values have more reliable, repeatable results.</p>
<p>--chaos accepts values 0–100.
The default --chaos value is 0.</p>
<p>The Influence of Chaos on Jobs
No --chaos value</p>
<p>Using a very low --chaos value, or not specifying a value, will produce initial image grids that are similar each time a Job is run.</p>
<p>prompt example: /imagine prompt: watermelon owl hybrid --c 0</p>
<p>Low --chaos values</p>
<p>Using a low --chaos value will produce initial image grids that are slightly varied each time a Job is run.</p>
<p>prompt example: /imagine prompt: watermelon owl hybrid --c 10</p>
<p>Moderate --chaos values</p>
<p>Using a moderate --chaos value will produce initial image grids that are varied each time a Job is run.</p>
<p>prompt example: /imagine prompt: watermelon owl hybrid --c 25</p>
<p>High --chaos Values</p>
<p>Using a higher --chaos value will produce initial image grids that are more varied and unexpected each time a Job is run.</p>
<p>prompt example: /imagine prompt: watermelon owl hybrid --c 50</p>
<p>Very High --chaos Values</p>
<p>Using extremely high --chaos values will produce initial image grids that are varied and have unexpected compositions or artistic mediums each time a Job is run.</p>
<p>prompt example: /imagine prompt: watermelon owl hybrid --c 80</p>
<p>How to Change the Chaos Value
Use the --chaos or --c Parameter</p>
<p>Add --chaos <value> or --c <value> to the end of your prompt.</p>

The --style parameter replaces the default aesthetic of some Midjourney Model Versions. Adding a style parameter can help you create more photo-realistic images, cinematic scenes, or cuter characters.</p>
<p>Default Model Version 5.2 and the previous version 5.1 accept --style raw.
Model Version Niji 5 accepts --style cute --style scenic --style original or --style expressive</p>
<p>Model Version 5.2 Styles</p>
<p>The current default Model Version 5.2 and the previous model version 5.1 have one style parameter, --style raw. --style raw uses an alternative model that may work well for users already comfortable with prompting who want more control over their images. Images made with --style raw have less automatic beautification applied, which can result in a more accurate match when prompting for specific styles.</p>
<p>Model Version 5.2
--v 5.2</p>
<p>ice cream icon</p>
<p>--v 5.2 --style raw</p>

<p>--v 5.2 --style raw</p>
<p>child's drawing of a cat --style raw</p>
<p>Niji 5 Styles</p>
<p>Niji Model Version 5 can also use different aesthetics with --style options to achieve unique looks. Try --style cute, --style scenic, --style original , or --style expressive.</p>
<p>Niji Style Parameters</p>
<p>--style cute creates charming and adorable characters, props, and settings.
--style expressive has a more sophisticated illustrated feeling.
--style original uses the original Niji Model Version 5, which was the default before May 26th, 2023.
--style scenic makes beautiful backgrounds and cinematic character moments in the context of their fantastical surroundings.</p>

Personalize the appearance of your Midjourney images using the Style Tuner. Use the /tune command to generate a range of sample images showing different visual styles based on your prompt. Choose your favorite images, and you'll receive a unique code you can use to customize the look of future Jobs.</p>
<p>Share your Style Tuner and Codes with others to share, explore, and experiment with different aesthetics.</p>
<p>/tune and codes are only compatible with Midjourney Model Version 5.2
/tune is only available while in Fast Mode.
--style parameters created with the Style Tuner are compatible with --stylize values between 20–1000.</p>
<p>How to Use the Style Tuner</p>
<ol>
<li>Generate Your Custom Style Tuner</li>
</ol>
<p>Create a Style Tuner page using the /tune command.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>Select Your Preferred Options
Style Directions: Choose the number of image pairs you want to see in your Style Tuner (16, 32, 64, or 128 pairs).
Default Mode: Select the style mode for your sample images (Default or Raw). If you typically do not use the --style raw parameter with your prompts, choose &quot;default.&quot;</li>
</ol>
<p>Use an Exisiting Style Tuner</p>
<p>If another user has previously generated a Style Tuner with your prompt, you will receive a link to that Tuner. Click the link to access the existing Style Tuner. Using a previously generated Style Tuner does not use your subscription's GPU minutes.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>Submit your Job
Click the Submit button.
Confirm your submission.</li>
</ol>
<p>Your Style Tuner generates a pair of images for each Style Direction. A Style Tuner with 16 directions will generate 32 images. A Style Tuner with 128 directions will generate 256 images. Generating these images uses your subscription's Fast GPU time.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>Open Your Custom Style Tuner
When your Style Tuner is ready, the Midjourney Bot will send you a direct message with a link to your Tuner.
Click the link to open your Style Tuner in your web browser.</li>
</ol>
<p>Try this Style Tuner: https://tuner.midjourney.com/ejYLCOY</p>
<ol start="5">
<li>Select images</li>
</ol>
<p>Your Style Tuner will show rows of image pairs, each representing a distinct visual direction for your prompt. Click on the image you prefer in each pair. If you don't feel strongly about either image, leave the empty middle box selected.</p>
<ol start="6">
<li>Copy Your Code</li>
</ol>
<p>The Style Tuner generates a code you can add to your prompts with the --style <code> Parameter. Learn more about parameters.</p>
<p>To copy your prompt and Parameter</p>
<p>Find your customized code at the bottom of the page.
Click the Copy button to copy your original prompt and newly generated --style <code> parameter.</p>
<p>You can share your Style Tuner page with friends and generate new codes without using any additional GPU minutes!</p>
<ol start="7">
<li>
<p>Generate an Image
Return to Discord
Use the /imagine command and paste your copied prompt and --style <code> parameter into the prompt field.
Generate your image</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Use Additional Midjourney Tools</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Take your image further by using other Midjourney tools like Upscale, Pan, Zoom-Out, Remix, or Vary-Region.</p>
<ol start="9">
<li>Experiment and Explore
Use your style code with a new prompt:</li>
</ol>
<p>The Style Tuner you create uses your initial prompt to create sample images and help you visualize the impact of your choices. However, the generated codes can be used with any prompt. Remember that styles and prompts always work together to generate an image, so a style code may not transfer as intended to other prompts.</p>
<p>Experiment: Style codes and prompts interact in complex ways. A code may have a strong effect on one prompt and a subtle effect on a similar prompt. The images you choose in your Style Tuner can combine in unexpected and creative ways. Use style codes as a tool to explore new looks and visuals.
Generate more codes: You can return to your Style Tuner page at any time to change your selections and create new codes.
Share style codes: You can share or use style codes created by friends. Check out the Midjourney style-tuner channel to share your codes and discover new styles!
Find a Style Tuner page: Find the Style Tuner page for any style code by adding it to this URL: https://tuner.midjourney.com/code/StyleCodeHere.</p>
<ol start="10">
<li>Save and Reuse Your Codes
Use the /settings command and turn on 📌Sticky Style. Sticky Style will save the last --style parameter used in your personal suffix, so you don't have to repeat the code on future prompts. Change codes by using a new --style or unselecting 📌Sticky Style.
Use custom options to store your favorite codes.
Or, create your own Discord server to organize your images, prompts, image references, and Style Tuner codes.</li>
</ol>
<p>Style Tune Examples</p>
<p>prompt vibrant california poppies
All images were made by style created using this Style Tuner</p>
<p>Random Codes</p>
<p>Use the --style random parameter to apply a random 32 base styles Style Tuner code to your prompt. You can also use --style random-16, --style random-64 or --style random-128 to use random results from other lengths of tuners.</p>
<p>--random simulates Style Tuner code with random selections chosen for 75% of the image pairs. You can adjust this percentage by adding a number to the end of the --random parameter. For example, --style random-32-15 simulates a 32-pair tuner with 15% of the image pairs selected, --style random-128-80 simulates a 128-pair tuner with 80% of the image pairs selected.</p>
<p>Combine Codes</p>
<p>Combine multiple codes in one parameter with a hyphen, --style code1-code2.
Combine multiple codes and style raw: --style raw-code1-code2</p>
<p>Style Tuner and --stylize</p>
<p>The --stylize parameter adjusts the influence of the --style parameter on your generated images. If you're not seeing the desired effect from your code, consider combining it with higher stylization values, like --stylize 250, or --stylize 500.</p>
<p>Comparison</p>
<p>prompt vibrant California poppies --style fdeQ4zOX5jd --stylize 250</p>
<p>--stylize 20</p>
<p>--stylize 100 (default)</p>
<p>--stylize 250</p>
<p>--stylize 750</p>
<p>Style Raw</p>
<p>Combine your custom style code with Midjourney Style Raw by using --style raw-<code>.
Example: To use Style Raw and --style fjo5S8BgMoV use --style raw-fjo5S8BgMoV.</p>
<p>Style Tuner and Niji Model Version</p>
<p>Style Tuner codes created with the Midjourney Bot are not compatible with the Niji Model version accessed through the Midjourney Bot. To create a Style Tuner or Code for Niji Model version, join the Niji Discord community and interact with the Niji Bot in the same way you interact with the Midjourney Bot. Your Midjourney subscription gives you access to the Niji community and Bot.</p>
<p>Technical Details</p>
<p>/tune is compatible with prompts that include the following:
--aspect
--chaos
--tile
multi prompts</p>
<p>/tune and style codes are not compatible with image prompts that do not include a text prompt.</p>

Stylize
Light
The Midjourney Bot has been trained to produce images that favor artistic color, composition, and forms. The --stylize or --s parameter influences how strongly this training is applied. Low stylization values produce images that closely match the prompt but are less artistic. High stylization values create images that are very artistic but less connected to the prompt.</p>
<p>--stylize's default value is 100 and accepts integer values 0–1000 when using the current model</p>
<p>Different Midjourney Version Models have different stylize ranges.</p>
<pre><code>Version 5, 5.1, 5.2	Version 4	niji 5
</code></pre>
<p>Stylize default	100	100	100
Stylize Range	0–1000	0–1000	0–1000</p>
<p>Common Stylize Settings
Influence of Stylize on Model Version 5.2</p>
<p>prompt example: /imagine prompt child's drawing of a cat --s 100</p>
<p>--stylize 0
--stylize 50
Equal to 🖌️ Style Low
--stylize 100 (default)
Equal to 🖌️ Style Med</p>
<p>--stylize 250
Equal to 🖌️ Style High
--stylize 500
--stylize 750
Equal to 🖌️ Style Very High</p>
<p>prompt example: /imagine prompt colorful risograph of a fig --s 100</p>
<p>--stylize 50</p>
<p>Equal to 🖌️ Style Low</p>
<p>--stylize 100 (default)</p>
<p>Equal to 🖌️ Style Med</p>
<p>--stylize 250</p>
<p>Equal to 🖌️ Style High</p>
<p>--stylize 750</p>
<p>Equal to 🖌️ Style Very High</p>
<p>Midjourney Model Version 5.2 is more sensitive to different stylize values. If you previously used very high stylize values, they may require adjustment for this model version. We recommend reducing your stylize value to 20% of your previous value. For example, if you were using --stylize 1000 --V 5.1, try using --stylize 200 instead.</p>
<p>Influence of Stylize on Model Version 5.1</p>
<p>prompt example: /imagine prompt colorful risograph of a fig --v 5.1 --s 100</p>
<p>--stylize 50</p>
<p>🖌️ Style Low</p>
<p>--stylize 100 (default)</p>
<p>🖌️ Style Med</p>
<p>--stylize 250</p>
<p>🖌️ Style High</p>
<p>--stylize 750</p>
<p>🖌️ Style Very High</p>
<p>Influence of Stylize on Niji 5</p>
<p>prompt example: /imagine prompt colorful risograph of a fig --niji 5 --s 100</p>
<p>--stylize 50</p>
<p>🖌️ Style Low</p>
<p>--stylize 100 (default)</p>
<p>🖌️ Style Med</p>
<p>--stylize 250</p>
<p>🖌️ Style High</p>
<p>--stylize 750</p>
<p>🖌️ Style Very High</p>
<p>Influence of Stylize on Model V4</p>
<p>prompt example: /imagine prompt illustrated figs --v 4 --s 100</p>
<p>--stylize 50</p>
<p>🖌️ Style Low</p>
<p>--stylize 100 (default)</p>
<p>🖌️ Style Med</p>
<p>--stylize 250</p>
<p>🖌️ Style High</p>
<p>--stylize 750</p>
<p>🖌️ Style Very High</p>
<p>How to Switch Stylization Values
Use the Stylize Parameter</p>
<p>Add --stylize <value> or --s <value> to the end of your prompt.</p>
<p>Use the Settings Command</p>
<p>Type /settings and select your preferred stylize value from the menu.</p>

You can use images as part of a prompt to influence a Job's composition, style, and colors. Images prompts can be used alone or with text prompts—experiment with combining images with different styles for the most exciting results.</p>
<p>To add images to a prompt, type or paste the web address where the image is stored online. The address must end in an extension like .png, .gif, or .jpg. After adding image addresses, add any additional text and parameters to complete the prompt.</p>
<p>Image prompts go at the front of a prompt.
Prompts must have two images or one image and text to work.
An image URL must be a direct link to an online image.
Your file should end in .png, .gif, .webp, .jpg, or .jpeg.
In most browsers, right-click or long-press an image and select Copy Image Address to get the URL.
The /blend command is a simplified image prompting process optimized for mobile users.</p>
<p>Upload an image to Discord</p>
<p>To incorporate an image into your prompt, you need a direct image link that ends with .png, .gif, .webp, .jpg, or .jpeg. If the image is on your computer or phone, you can send it as a message to the Midjourney Bot first to generate a link.</p>
<p>How To Upload Your Image
Paste the image into the chat with Midjourney Bot. Press Enter to send your image.
Depending on your platform, follow these steps to obtain the image link</p>
<p>Discord Desktop App: Right-click on the image and select &quot;Copy Link&quot; (NOT &quot;Copy Message Link&quot;).</p>
<p>Discord Web App: Click to expand the image, then right-click and choose &quot;Copy image address.&quot;</p>
<p>Discord Mobile App: Tap and hold on the image, then select &quot;Copy Media Link.&quot;</p>
<p>If none of these methods work, you can always click to expand the image, and at the bottom, select &quot;Open in Browser&quot; so you can copy and paste the image's URL.</p>
<p>Add an Image URL to Your Prompt</p>
<p>To add an image to a prompt, begin typing /imagine as usual. After the prompt box appears, drag the image file into the prompt box to add the image's URL, or right-click and paste the link within the prompt box.</p>
<p>Privacy Notes</p>

The /blend command allows you to upload 2–5 images quickly and then looks at the concepts and aesthetics of each image and merges them into a novel new image.</p>
<p>/blend is the same as using multiple image prompts with /imagine, but the interface is optimized for easy use on mobile devices.
/blend works with up to 5 images. To use more than 5 images in a prompt use image prompts with /imagine
/blend does not work with text prompts. To use text and image prompts together, use image prompts and text with /imagine</p>
<p>/blend Options</p>
<p>After typing the /blend command, you will be prompted to upload two photos. Drag and drop images from your hard drive or add images from your photo library when using a mobile device. To add more images, select the optional/options field and select image3, image4, or image5. The /blend command may take longer to start than other commands because your images must be uploaded before the Midjourney Bot can process your request.</p>
<p>Blended images have a default 1:1 aspect ratio, but you can use the optional dimensions field to select between a square aspect ratio (1:1), portrait aspect ration (2:3), or landscape aspect ratio (3:2).</p>
<p>Custom suffixes are added to the end of /blend prompts, like any other /imagine prompt. Aspect ratios specified as part of the /blend command override aspect ratios within a custom suffix.</p>
<p>Blending Tip</p>
<p>For the best results, upload images that are the same aspect ratio as your desired result.</p>

The /shorten command analyzes your prompt, highlights some of your prompt's most influential words, and suggests unnecessary words you could remove. With this command, you can optimize your prompt by focusing on essential terms.</p>
<p>/shorten is not compatible with multi prompts or the --no parameter</p>
<p>Analyze a Prompt with /Shorten</p>
<p>The Midjourney bot analyzes your prompt by breaking it down into smaller units known as tokens. These tokens can be phrases, words, or even syllables. The Midjourney bot converts these tokens into a format it can understand. It uses them with the associations and patterns learned during its training to guide how your image is generated. Think of tokens as the building blocks that help the Midjourney bot make sense of the input and create the desired visual output.</p>
<p>Long prompts with unnecessary words, lengthy descriptions, poetic phrases, or direct addressing of the bot (&quot;Please make me an image,&quot; &quot;Thank you for your help, Midjourney Bot!&quot;) can lead to unexpected elements being added to your images.</p>
<p>The /shorten command can help you discover the most important words in your prompt and what words you can omit.</p>
<p>Shorten Command Example</p>
<p>If you want to create a pile of sprinkle covered donuts you might try the prompt:
Please create a whimsical majestic tower of donuts, intricately crafted and adorned with a mesmerizing array of colorful sprinkles. Bring this sugary masterpiece to life, ensuring every detail is rendered in stunning magical realism. Thank you!</p>
<p>If you use /shorten command with the above prompt the Midjourney Bot will return the following information:</p>
<p>IMPORTANT TOKENS
Please create a whimsical majestic tower of donuts, intricately crafted and adorned with a mesmerizing array of colorful sprinkles. Bring this sugary masterpiece to life, ensuring every detail is rendered in stunning magical realism. Thank you!</p>
<p>SHORTENED PROMPTS
1️⃣ Please, majestic tower of donuts, crafted, array of colorful sprinkles, sugary masterpiece, rendered, magical realism</p>
<p>2️⃣ Please, majestic tower of donuts, colorful sprinkles, sugary masterpiece, rendered, magical realism</p>
<p>3️⃣ majestic tower of donuts, colorful sprinkles, sugary, magical realism</p>
<p>4️⃣ majestic tower of donuts, colorful sprinkles, magical</p>
<p>5️⃣ tower of donuts, sprinkles</p>
<p>The most Important tokens in your prompt are highlighted in bold, the least important are stikethroughed. You will also be given 5 possible shorter prompts based on this information.</p>
<p>Shortened Option 1️⃣ </p>
<p>Please, majestic tower of donuts, crafted, array of colorful sprinkles, sugary masterpiece, rendered, magical realism</p>
<p>Shortened Option 2️⃣ </p>
<p>Please, majestic tower of donuts, colorful sprinkles, sugary masterpiece, rendered, magical realism</p>
<p>Shortened Option 3️⃣ </p>
<p>majestic tower of donuts, colorful sprinkles, sugary, magical realism</p>
<p>Shortened Option 4️⃣ </p>
<p>majestic tower of donuts, colorful sprinkles, magical</p>
<p>Shortened Option 5️⃣ </p>
<p>tower of donuts, sprinkles</p>
<p>Analyzing the Results</p>
<p>The shortest prompt, Option 5️⃣ : tower of donuts, sprinkles produced an image closest to the original goal. Many of the filler words like &quot;whimsical,&quot; &quot;mesmerizing,&quot; and &quot;masterpiece&quot; could be omitted. Learning that &quot;tower&quot; and &quot;magical&quot; were considered important tokens helps explain why some images were generated with fairytale castle elements. Learning this provided a clue that &quot;magical&quot; should be removed from the prompt if the goal was to create a stack of delicious donuts.</p>
<p>The /shorten command is a tool to help you explore how the Midjourney Bot interprets tokens and experiment with words, but it may not work for all subjects and styles of prompting.</p>
<p>How to Use Shorten</p>
<p>Use the /shorten <your prompt> command in any Bot Channel to get information on your prompt</p>

Use Remix Mode to change prompts, parameters, model versions, or aspect ratios between variations. Remix will take the general composition of your starting image and use it as part of the new Job. Remixing can help change the setting or lighting of an image, evolve a subject, or achieve tricky compositions.</p>
<p>Remix is an experimental feature that may change or be removed at any time.</p>
<p>Using Remix</p>
<p>Activate Remix mode with the /prefer remix command or by using the /settings command and toggling the 🎛️ Remix Mode button. Remix changes the behavior of the variation buttons (V1, V2, V3, V4) under image grids. When Remix is enabled, it allows you to edit your prompt during each variation. To Remix an upscale select 🪄 Make Variations.</p>
<p>When Remix is enabled, Variation buttons turn green when used instead of blue.
You can switch Model Versions when using Remix.
When you are done with Remix use the /settings or /prefer remix command to turn it off.
Create a standard image variation when Remix is active by not modifying the prompt in the pop-up window.</p>
<p>Step 1</p>
<p>line-art stack of pumpkins</p>
<p>Turn on Remix mode.</p>
<p>Select an image grid or upscaled image to Remix.</p>
<p>Step 2</p>
<p>Remix</p>
<p>Select &quot;Make Variations.&quot;</p>
<p>Modify or enter a new prompt in the pop-up.</p>
<p>Results</p>

<p>Medium Change</p>
<p>vibrant illustrated stack of fruit</p>
<p>Using Parameters with Remix</p>
<p>You can add or remove Parameters while using Remix mode, but you must use valid parameter combinations. Changing /imagine prompt illustrated stack of pumpkins --version 3 --stylize 10000 to illustrated stack of pumpkins --version 4 --stylize 10000 will return an error because Midjourney Model Version 4 is incompatible with the Stylize parameter.</p>
<p>Only parameters that normally influence variations will work while using Remix:</p>

The Midjourney Bot can blend multiple concepts using :: as a separator. Using a multi-prompt allows you to assign relative importance to the concept in the prompt, helping you control how they are blended together.
Multi-Prompt Basics</p>
<p>Adding a double colon :: to a prompt indicates to the Midjourney Bot that it should consider each part of the prompt individually. For the prompt space ship both words are considered together, and the Midjourney Bot produces images of sci-fi spaceships. If the prompt is separated into two parts, space:: ship, both concepts are considered separately, then blended together creating a sailing ship traveling through space.</p>
<p>There is no space between the double colons ::
Multi-prompts work with Model Versions 1, 2, 3, 4, '5, niji, and niji 5
Any parameters are still added to the very end of the prompt.</p>
<p>space ship</p>
<p>space ship is considered as a single thought.</p>
<p>space:: ship</p>
<p>space and ship are considered separate thoughts</p>
<p>cheese cake painting</p>
<p>cheese cake painting is considered together, producing a painted image of a cheesecake.</p>
<p>cheese:: cake painting</p>
<p>cheese is considered separately from cake painting, producing images of painted cakes made of cheeses.</p>
<p>cheese:: cake:: painting</p>
<p>cheese, cake, and painting are considered separately, producing tiered cakes, made of cheeses with common classical painting compositions and elements.</p>
<p>Prompt Weights</p>
<p>When a double colon :: is used to separate a prompt into different parts, you can add a number immediately after the double colon to assign the relative importance to that part of the prompt.</p>
<p>In the example below, the prompt space:: ship produced a sailing ship traveling through space. Changing the prompt to space::2 ship makes the word space twice as important as the word ship, producing images of space that have ships as a supporting element.</p>
<p>[Model Versions] 1, 2, 3 only accept whole numbers as weights
[Model Versions] 4, niji 4, niji 5, 5, 5.1, and 5.2 and can accept decimal places for weights
Non-specified weights default to 1.</p>
<p>space:: ship</p>
<p>space and ship are considered as separate thoughts</p>
<p>space::2 ship</p>
<p>space is twice as important as ship</p>
<p>Weights are normalized:
space:: ship is the same as space::1 ship, space:: ship::1,space::2 ship::2, space::100 ship::100, etc.
cheese::2 cake is the same as cheese::4 cake::2, cheese::100 cake::50 etc.
cheese:: cake:: painting is the same as cheese::1 cake::1 painting::1, cheese::1 cake:: painting::, cheese::2 cake::2 painting::2 etc.</p>
<p>Negative Prompt Weights</p>
<p>Negative weights can be added to parts of a multi-prompt to help remove unwanted elements.
The sum of all weights must be a positive number.</p>
<p>still life gouache painting</p>
<p>a range of objects appear in the still life</p>
<p>still life gouache painting:: fruit::-.5</p>
<p>The still life has fewer fruits</p>
<p>The --no Parameter</p>
<p>The --no parameter is the same as weighing part of a multi prompt to &quot;-.5&quot; vibrant tulip fields:: red::-.5 is the same as vibrant tulip fields --no red.</p>

The No parameter tells the Midjourney Bot what not to include in your image.</p>
<p>--no accepts multiple words separated with commas: --no item1, item2, item3, item4</p>
<p>--No Comparison</p>
<p>still life gouache painting</p>
<p>a range of objects appear in the still life</p>
<p>still life gouache painting --no fruit</p>
<p>The still life has fewer fruits</p>
<p>--no vs. Don't</p>
<p>The Midjourney Bot considers any word within the prompt as something you would like to see generated in the final image. Prompting still life gouache painting without any fruit or still life gouache painting dont add fruit! are more likely to produce pictures that include fruits because the relationship between &quot;without&quot; or &quot;don't&quot; and the &quot;fruit&quot; is not interpreted by the Midjourney Bot in the same way a human reader would understand it. To improve your results, focus your prompt on what you do want to see in the image and use the &quot;--no&quot; parameter to specify concepts you don't want to include.</p>
<p>still life gouache painting</p>
<p>a range of objects appear in the still life</p>
<p>still life gouache painting don't add fruit</p>
<p>more fruit is present in the final image.</p>
<p>Multi Prompting</p>
<p>The --no parameter is the same as weighing part of a multi prompt to &quot;-.5&quot; still life gouache painting:: fruit::-.5 is the same as still life gouache painting --no fruit.</p>
<p>How to Use the No Paramter</p>
<p>Add --no item1, item2, item3 to the end of your prompt.</p>

Prompts

A Prompt is a short text phrase that the Midjourney Bot interprets to produce an image. The Midjourney Bot breaks down the words and phrases in a prompt into smaller pieces, called tokens, that can be compared to its training data and then used to generate an image. A well-crafted prompt can help make unique and exciting images.
Basic Prompts</p>
<p>A basic prompt can be as simple as a single word, phrase or emoji</p>
<p>Prompting Tip!</p>
<p>The Midjourney Bot works best with simple, short sentences that describe what you want to see. Avoid long lists of requests. Instead of: Show me a picture of lots of blooming California poppies, make them bright, vibrant orange, and draw them in an illustrated style with colored pencils Try: Bright orange California poppies drawn with colored pencils</p>
<p>Advanced Prompts</p>
<p>More advanced prompts can include one or more image URLs, multiple text phrases, and one or more parameters</p>
<p>Image Prompts</p>
<p>Image URLs can be added to a prompt to influence the style and content of the finished result. Image URLs always go at the front of a prompt.</p>
<p>Read more about Image Prompts</p>
<p>Prompt Text</p>
<p>The text description of what image you want to generate. See below for prompting information and tips. Well-written prompts help generate amazing images.</p>
<p>Parameters</p>
<p>Parameters change how an image generates. Parameters can change aspect ratios, models, upscalers, and lots more. Parameters go at the end of the prompt.</p>
<p>Read more about Parameters</p>
<p>Prompting Notes
Prompt Length</p>
<p>Prompts can be very simple. Single words (or even an emoji!) will produce an image. Very short prompts will rely heavily on Midjourney’s default style, so a more descriptive prompt is better for a unique look. However, super-long prompts aren’t always better. Concentrate on the main concepts you want to create.</p>
<p>Grammar</p>
<p>The Midjourney Bot does not understand grammar, sentence structure, or words like humans. Word choice also matters. More specific synonyms work better in many circumstances. Instead of big, try gigantic, enormous, or immense. Remove words when possible. Fewer words mean each word has a more powerful influence. Use commas, brackets, and hyphens to help organize your thoughts, but know the Midjourney Bot will not reliably interpret them. The Midjourney Bot does not consider capitalization.</p>
<p>Midjourney Model Version 4 is slightly better than other models at interpreting traditional sentence structure.</p>
<p>Focus on What you Want</p>
<p>It is better to describe what you want instead of what you don’t want. If you ask for a party with “no cake,” your image will probably include a cake. If you want to ensure an object is not in the final image, try advance prompting using the --no parameter.</p>
<p>Think About What Details Matter</p>
<p>Anything left unsaid may surprise you. Be as specific or vague as you want, but anything you leave out will be randomized. Being vague is a great way to get variety, but you may not get the specific details you want.</p>
<p>Try to be clear about any context or details that are important to you. Think about:</p>
<p>Subject: person, animal, character, location, object, etc.
Medium: photo, painting, illustration, sculpture, doodle, tapestry, etc.
Environment: indoors, outdoors, on the moon, in Narnia, underwater, the Emerald City, etc.
Lighting: soft, ambient, overcast, neon, studio lights, etc
Color: vibrant, muted, bright, monochromatic, colorful, black and white, pastel, etc.
Mood: Sedate, calm, raucous, energetic, etc.
Composition: Portrait, headshot, closeup, birds-eye view, etc.</p>
<p>Use Collective Nouns</p>
<p>Plural words leave a lot to chance. Try specific numbers. &quot;Three cats&quot; is more specific than &quot;cats.&quot; Collective nouns also work, “flock of birds” instead of &quot;birds.”</p>

Zoom Out
Light
The Zoom Out option allows you to extend the canvas of an upscaled image beyond its original boundaries without changing the content of the original image. The newly expanded canvas will be filled-in using guidance from the prompt and the original image.</p>
<p>Zoom Out does not increase the maximum 1024px x 1024 px size of an image.</p>
<p>Zoom Out</p>
<p>🔎 Zoom Out 2X 🔎 Zoom Out 1.5X buttons will appear after upscaling an image.</p>
<p>Prompt: vibrant California poppies</p>
<p>Starting Image
Zoom Out 1.5X
Zoom Out 2X</p>
<p>Make Square</p>
<p>With Make Square you can adjust the aspect ratio of a non-square image to make it square. If the original aspect ratio is wide (landscape), it will be expanded vertically. If it is tall (portrait), it will be expanded horizontally. The emoji ↔️ ↕️ next to the ↔️ Make Square button also indicates which way the image will be expanded. The ↔️ Make Square button will appear underneath non-square upscaled images.</p>
<p>Prompt: vibrant California poppies</p>

<p>Custom Zoom</p>
<p>The 🔎 Custom Zoom button lets you choose how much to zoom out on an image. 🔎 Custom Zoom button under an upscaled image will pop up a dialogue box where you enter a custom value for --zoom. --zoom accepts values between 1-2.</p>
<p>Change the Aspect Ratio of an Upscaled Image</p>
<p>You can use --zoom 1 in this Custom Zoom pop-up box to change the aspect ratio, with the --ar parameter, without zooming out.</p>
<p>Change Your Prompt with Custom Zoom</p>
<p>🔎 Custom Zoom allows you to change the prompt before you expand your image, giving you finer control over the finished image. For example, changing the prompt to &quot;A framed picture on the wall&quot; gives this result:</p>
<p>Starting Image</p>
<p>prompt: vibrant California poppies</p>
<p>Custom Zoom + Changed Prompt</p>
<p>Zoom Out prompt: A framed picture on the wall --zoom 2</p>

Style Tuner
Light
Personalize the appearance of your Midjourney images using the Style Tuner. Use the /tune command to generate a range of sample images showing different visual styles based on your prompt. Choose your favorite images, and you'll receive a unique code you can use to customize the look of future Jobs.</p>
<p>Share your Style Tuner and Codes with others to share, explore, and experiment with different aesthetics.</p>
<p>/tune and codes are only compatible with Midjourney Model Version 5.2
/tune is only available while in Fast Mode.
--style parameters created with the Style Tuner are compatible with --stylize values between 20–1000.</p>
<p>How to Use the Style Tuner</p>
<ol>
<li>Generate Your Custom Style Tuner</li>
</ol>
<p>Create a Style Tuner page using the /tune command.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>Select Your Preferred Options
Style Directions: Choose the number of image pairs you want to see in your Style Tuner (16, 32, 64, or 128 pairs).
Default Mode: Select the style mode for your sample images (Default or Raw). If you typically do not use the --style raw parameter with your prompts, choose &quot;default.&quot;</li>
</ol>
<p>Use an Exisiting Style Tuner</p>
<p>If another user has previously generated a Style Tuner with your prompt, you will receive a link to that Tuner. Click the link to access the existing Style Tuner. Using a previously generated Style Tuner does not use your subscription's GPU minutes.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>Submit your Job
Click the Submit button.
Confirm your submission.</li>
</ol>
<p>Your Style Tuner generates a pair of images for each Style Direction. A Style Tuner with 16 directions will generate 32 images. A Style Tuner with 128 directions will generate 256 images. Generating these images uses your subscription's Fast GPU time.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>Open Your Custom Style Tuner
When your Style Tuner is ready, the Midjourney Bot will send you a direct message with a link to your Tuner.
Click the link to open your Style Tuner in your web browser.</li>
</ol>
<p>Try this Style Tuner: https://tuner.midjourney.com/ejYLCOY</p>
<ol start="5">
<li>Select images</li>
</ol>
<p>Your Style Tuner will show rows of image pairs, each representing a distinct visual direction for your prompt. Click on the image you prefer in each pair. If you don't feel strongly about either image, leave the empty middle box selected.</p>
<ol start="6">
<li>Copy Your Code</li>
</ol>
<p>The Style Tuner generates a code you can add to your prompts with the --style <code> Parameter. Learn more about parameters.</p>
<p>To copy your prompt and Parameter</p>
<p>Find your customized code at the bottom of the page.
Click the Copy button to copy your original prompt and newly generated --style <code> parameter.</p>
<p>You can share your Style Tuner page with friends and generate new codes without using any additional GPU minutes!</p>
<ol start="7">
<li>
<p>Generate an Image
Return to Discord
Use the /imagine command and paste your copied prompt and --style <code> parameter into the prompt field.
Generate your image</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Use Additional Midjourney Tools</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Take your image further by using other Midjourney tools like Upscale, Pan, Zoom-Out, Remix, or Vary-Region.</p>
<ol start="9">
<li>Experiment and Explore
Use your style code with a new prompt:</li>
</ol>
<p>The Style Tuner you create uses your initial prompt to create sample images and help you visualize the impact of your choices. However, the generated codes can be used with any prompt. Remember that styles and prompts always work together to generate an image, so a style code may not transfer as intended to other prompts.</p>
<p>Experiment: Style codes and prompts interact in complex ways. A code may have a strong effect on one prompt and a subtle effect on a similar prompt. The images you choose in your Style Tuner can combine in unexpected and creative ways. Use style codes as a tool to explore new looks and visuals.
Generate more codes: You can return to your Style Tuner page at any time to change your selections and create new codes.
Share style codes: You can share or use style codes created by friends. Check out the Midjourney style-tuner channel to share your codes and discover new styles!
Find a Style Tuner page: Find the Style Tuner page for any style code by adding it to this URL: https://tuner.midjourney.com/code/StyleCodeHere.</p>
<ol start="10">
<li>Save and Reuse Your Codes
Use the /settings command and turn on 📌Sticky Style. Sticky Style will save the last --style parameter used in your personal suffix, so you don't have to repeat the code on future prompts. Change codes by using a new --style or unselecting 📌Sticky Style.
Use custom options to store your favorite codes.
Or, create your own Discord server to organize your images, prompts, image references, and Style Tuner codes.</li>
</ol>
<p>Style Tune Examples</p>
<p>prompt vibrant california poppies
All images were made by style created using this Style Tuner</p>
<p>Random Codes</p>
<p>Use the --style random parameter to apply a random 32 base styles Style Tuner code to your prompt. You can also use --style random-16, --style random-64 or --style random-128 to use random results from other lengths of tuners.</p>
<p>--random simulates Style Tuner code with random selections chosen for 75% of the image pairs. You can adjust this percentage by adding a number to the end of the --random parameter. For example, --style random-32-15 simulates a 32-pair tuner with 15% of the image pairs selected, --style random-128-80 simulates a 128-pair tuner with 80% of the image pairs selected.</p>
<p>Combine Codes</p>
<p>Combine multiple codes in one parameter with a hyphen, --style code1-code2.
Combine multiple codes and style raw: --style raw-code1-code2</p>
<p>Style Tuner and --stylize</p>
<p>The --stylize parameter adjusts the influence of the --style parameter on your generated images. If you're not seeing the desired effect from your code, consider combining it with higher stylization values, like --stylize 250, or --stylize 500.</p>
<p>Comparison</p>
<p>prompt vibrant California poppies --style fdeQ4zOX5jd --stylize 250</p>
<p>--stylize 20</p>
<p>--stylize 100 (default)</p>
<p>--stylize 250</p>
<p>--stylize 750</p>
<p>Style Raw</p>
<p>Combine your custom style code with Midjourney Style Raw by using --style raw-<code>.
Example: To use Style Raw and --style fjo5S8BgMoV use --style raw-fjo5S8BgMoV.</p>
<p>Style Tuner and Niji Model Version</p>
<p>Style Tuner codes created with the Midjourney Bot are not compatible with the Niji Model version accessed through the Midjourney Bot. To create a Style Tuner or Code for Niji Model version, join the Niji Discord community and interact with the Niji Bot in the same way you interact with the Midjourney Bot. Your Midjourney subscription gives you access to the Niji community and Bot.</p>
<p>Technical Details</p>
<p>/tune is compatible with prompts that include the following:
--aspect
--chaos
--tile
multi prompts</p>
<p>/tune and style codes are not compatible with image prompts that do not include a text prompt.</p>
<p>If your /tune command does not return a clickable link, check that Embeds and Link Previews is enabled in your Discord App Settings</p>

The current Midjourney and Niji Model Versions produce grids of 1024 x 1024 pixel images. Use the U1 U2 U3 U4 buttons under each image grid to separate your selected image. You can then use the Upscale (2x) or Upscale (4x) tools to increase the size of your image.</p>
<p>Upscale tools use your subscription's GPU minutes. Using Upscale 2X on an image takes roughly twice as long as generating an initial image grid. Using Upscale 4X on an image takes roughly six times as long as generating an initial image grid.</p>
<p>Upscale tools are not compatible with the pan tool or the tile parameter.</p>

But selecting too much may lead to the newly generated elements blending or replacing parts of the original image you wished to preserve.</p>
<p>Prompts Experiment with how you modify your prompt when Using Vary Region + Remix Mode. Prompts should focus on what you want to happen in the selected area. The Midjourney Bot also considers the existing image when generating a selected area, so shorter focused prompts often are more effective. Midjourney Prompts should not be conversational. Instead of &quot;Please change the meadow trail into a beautiful stream,&quot; be direct and prompt &quot;meadow stream.&quot;</p>
<p>Work in Small Steps If you want to change many parts of an image, work on one part at a time. This way, you can create a focused prompt for each part.</p>

Weird
Light
Explore unconventional aesthetics with the experimental --weird or --w parameter. This parameter introduces quirky and offbeat qualities to your generated images, resulting in unique and unexpected outcomes.</p>
<p>--weird accepts values: 0–3000.
The default --weird value is 0.
--weird is a highly experimental feature. What's weird may change over time
--weird is compatible with Midjourney Model Versions 5, 5.1, 5.2 and niji 5
--weird is not fully compatible with seeds</p>
<p>The Influence of Weird on Jobs</p>
<p>The optimal --weird value is dependent on the prompt and requires experimentation. Try starting with smaller values, such as 250 or 500, and then go up/down from there. If you want a generation to be conventionally attractive and weird, try mixing higher --stylize values with --weird. Try starting with similar values for both. Example /imagine prompt cyanotype cat --stylize 250 --weird 250.</p>
<p>prompt example: /imagine prompt cyanotype cat --weird 250</p>
<p>--weird 0
--weird 250
--weird 500
--weird 1000</p>
<p>prompt example: /imagine prompt lithograph potato --weird 250</p>
<p>--weird 0
--weird 250
--weird 500
--weird 1000</p>
<p>prompt example: /imagine prompt clockwork chicken --weird 250</p>
<p>--weird 0
--weird 250
--weird 500
--weird 1000</p>
<p>What's the difference between --weird, --chaos, and --stylize?</p>
<p>--chaos controls how diverse the initial grid images are from each other.
--stylize controls how strongly Midjourney's default aesthetic is applied.
--weird controls how unusual an image is compared to previous Midjourney images.</p>
<p>How to Use the Weird Parameter</p>
<p>Add --weird <value> or --w <value> to the end of your prompt.</p>

Midjourney routinely releases new model versions to improve efficiency, coherency, and quality. The latest model is the default, but other models can be used by adding the --version or --v parameter or by using the /settings command and selecting a model version. Each model excels at producing different types of images.</p>
<p>--version accepts the values 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 5.1, and 5.2
--version can be abbreviated --v
--v 5.2 is the current default model.</p>
<p>Model Version 5.2</p>
<p>The Midjourney V5.2 model is the newest and most advanced, released June 2023. To use this model, add the --v 5.2 parameter to the end of a prompt, or use the /settings command and select 5️⃣ MJ Version 5.2</p>
<p>Default Model 06/22/23–current</p>
<p>This model produces more detailed, sharper results with better colors, contrast, and compositions. It also has a slightly better understanding of prompts than earlier models and is more responsive to the full range of the --stylize parameter.</p>
<p>Prompt: vibrant California poppies --v 5.2
Prompt: high contrast surreal collage --v 5.2</p>
<p>Model Version 5.2 + Style Raw Parameter</p>
<p>Midjourney Model Versions 5.1 and 5.2 can be fine-tuned with the --style raw parameter to reduce the Midjourney default aesthetic.</p>
<p>Read more about the Midjourney --style parameter.</p>

<p>Model Version 5.1</p>
<p>The Midjourney V5.1 was released on May 4th, 2023. To use this model, add the --v 5.1 parameter to the end of a prompt, or use the /settings command and select 5️⃣ MJ Version 5.1</p>
<p>Default Model 05/03/23–06/22/23</p>
<p>This model has a stronger default aesthetic than earlier versions, making it easier to use with simple text prompts. It also has high Coherency, excels at accurately interpreting natural language prompts, produces fewer unwanted artifacts and borders, has increased image sharpness, and supports advanced features like repeating patterns with --tile.</p>
<p>Prompt: vibrant California poppies --v 5.1
Prompt: high contrast surreal collage --v 5.1</p>
<p>Model Version 5.0</p>
<p>The Midjourney V5.0 model produces more photographic generations than the V5.1 model. This model produces images that closely match the prompt but may require longer prompts to achieve your desired aesthetic.</p>
<p>Default Model 03/30/23–05/03/23</p>
<p>To use this model, add the --v 5 parameter to the end of a prompt, or use the /settings command and select 5️⃣ MJ Version 5</p>
<p>Prompt: vibrant California poppies --v 5
Prompt: high contrast surreal collage --v 5</p>
<p>Model Version 4</p>
<p>The Midjourney V4 was the default model from Nov 2022–May 2023. This model featured an entirely new codebase and brand-new AI architecture designed by Midjourney and trained on the new Midjourney AI supercluster. Model Version 4 had increased knowledge of creatures, places, and objects compared to previous models.</p>
<p>This model has very high Coherency and excels with Image Prompts.</p>
<p>Prompt: vibrant California poppies
Prompt: high contrast surreal collage</p>
<p>Niji Model 5</p>
<p>The Niji model is a collaboration between Midjourney and Spellbrush tuned to produce anime and illustrative styles with vastly more knowledge of anime, anime styles, and anime aesthetics. It's excellent at dynamic and action shots and character-focused compositions.</p>
<p>To use this model, add the --niji 5 parameter to the end of a prompt, or use the /settings command and select 🍏 Niji version 5</p>
<p>This model is sensitive to the --stylize parameter. Experiment with different stylization ranges to fine-tune your images.</p>
<p>Niji Style Parameters</p>
<p>Niji Model Version 5 can also be fine-tuned with --style parameters to achieve unique looks. Try --style cute, --style scenic, --style original (uses the original Niji Model Version 5, which was the default before May 26th, 2023), or --style expressive.</p>

Stylize
Light
The Midjourney Bot has been trained to produce images that favor artistic color, composition, and forms. The --stylize or --s parameter influences how strongly this training is applied. Low stylization values produce images that closely match the prompt but are less artistic. High stylization values create images that are very artistic but less connected to the prompt.</p>
<p>--stylize's default value is 100 and accepts integer values 0–1000 when using the current model</p>
<p>Different Midjourney Version Models have different stylize ranges.</p>
<pre><code>Version 5, 5.1, 5.2	Version 4	niji 5
</code></pre>
<p>Stylize default	100	100	100
Stylize Range	0–1000	0–1000	0–1000</p>
<p>Common Stylize Settings
Influence of Stylize on Model Version 5.2</p>
<p>prompt example: /imagine prompt child's drawing of a cat --s 100</p>
<p>--stylize 0
--stylize 50
Equal to 🖌️ Style Low
--stylize 100 (default)
Equal to 🖌️ Style Med</p>
<p>--stylize 250
Equal to 🖌️ Style High
--stylize 500
--stylize 750
Equal to 🖌️ Style Very High</p>
<p>prompt example: /imagine prompt colorful risograph of a fig --s 100</p>
<p>--stylize 50</p>
<p>Equal to 🖌️ Style Low</p>
<p>--stylize 100 (default)</p>

<p>--stylize 250</p>
<p>Equal to 🖌️ Style High</p>
<p>--stylize 750</p>
<p>Equal to 🖌️ Style Very High</p>
<p>Midjourney Model Version 5.2 is more sensitive to different stylize values. If you previously used very high stylize values, they may require adjustment for this model version. We recommend reducing your stylize value to 20% of your previous value. For example, if you were using --stylize 1000 --V 5.1, try using --stylize 200 instead.</p>
<p>Influence of Stylize on Model Version 5.1</p>

The Midjourney bot uses a seed number to create a field of visual noise, like television static, as a starting point to generate the initial image grids. Seed numbers are generated randomly for each image but can be specified with the --seed parameter. If you use the same seed number and prompt, you will get similar final images.
--seed accepts whole numbers 0–4294967295.
--seed values only influence the initial image grid.
Identical --seed values using Model Versions 1, 2, 3, test, and testp will produce images with similar composition, color, and details.
Identical --seed values using Model Versions 4, 5, and niji will produce nearly identical images.
Seed numbers are not static and should not be relied upon between sessions.
Seed Parameter</p>
<p>If no Seed is specified, Midjourney will use a randomly generated seed number, producing a wide variety of options each time a prompt is used.</p>
<p>Jobs run three times with random seeds:</p>
<p>prompt example: /imagine prompt celadon owl pitcher</p>
<p>Jobs run two times with --seed 123:</p>
<p>prompt example: /imagine prompt celadon owl pitcher --seed 123</p>
<p>How to Find a Job's Seed Number
Use a Discord Emoji Reaction</p>
<p>Find the seed number of a Job in discord by reacting with an ✉️ envelope emoji to a Job.</p>
<p>Use The Show Command to Bring Back Old Jobs</p>
<p>To get the seed number for a past image, copy the job ID and use the /show &lt;Job ID #&gt; command with that ID to revive the Job. You can then react to the newly regenerated Job with an ✉️ envelope emoji.</p>
<p>How To Change Seed Numbers
Use the --seed Parameter</p>
<p>Add --seed <value> to the end of your prompt.</p>

The --style parameter replaces the default aesthetic of some Midjourney Model Versions. Adding a style parameter can help you create more photo-realistic images, cinematic scenes, or cuter characters.</p>
<p>Default Model Version 5.2 and the previous version 5.1 accept --style raw.
Model Version Niji 5 accepts --style cute --style scenic --style original or --style expressive</p>
<p>Model Version 5.2 Styles</p>
<p>The current default Model Version 5.2 and the previous model version 5.1 have one style parameter, --style raw. --style raw uses an alternative model that may work well for users already comfortable with prompting who want more control over their images. Images made with --style raw have less automatic beautification applied, which can result in a more accurate match when prompting for specific styles.</p>
<p>Model Version 5.2
--v 5.2</p>
<p>ice cream icon</p>
<p>--v 5.2 --style raw</p>
<p>ice cream icon --style raw</p>

<p>child's drawing of a cat</p>
<p>--v 5.2 --style raw</p>
<p>child's drawing of a cat --style raw</p>
<p>Niji 5 Styles</p>
<p>Niji Model Version 5 can also use different aesthetics with --style options to achieve unique looks. Try --style cute, --style scenic, --style original , or --style expressive.</p>
<p>Niji Style Parameters</p>
<p>--style cute creates charming and adorable characters, props, and settings.
--style expressive has a more sophisticated illustrated feeling.
--style original uses the original Niji Model Version 5, which was the default before May 26th, 2023.
--style scenic makes beautiful backgrounds and cinematic character moments in the context of their fantastical surroundings.</p>

The --quality or --q parameter changes how much time is spent generating an image. Higher-quality settings take longer to process and produce more details. Higher values also mean more GPU minutes are used per job. The quality setting does not impact resolution.</p>
<p>The default --quality value is 1.
--quality only accepts the values: .25, .5, and 1 for the current model. Larger values are rounded down to 1.
--quality only influences the initial image generation.
--quality works with Model Versions 4, 5, 5.1, 5.2, and niji 5.</p>
<p>The Influence of Quality on Jobs</p>
<p>Higher --quality settings aren't always better. Sometimes a lower --quality settings can produce better results—depending on the image you're trying to create. Lower --quality settings might be best for a gestural abstract look. Higher --quality values may improve the look of architectural images that benefit from many details. Choose the setting that best matches the kind of image you're hoping to create.</p>

The No parameter tells the Midjourney Bot what not to include in your image.</p>
<p>--no accepts multiple words separated with commas: --no item1, item2, item3, item4</p>
<p>--No Comparison</p>
<p>still life gouache painting</p>
<p>a range of objects appear in the still life</p>
<p>still life gouache painting --no fruit</p>
<p>The still life has fewer fruits</p>
<p>--no vs. Don't</p>
<p>The Midjourney Bot considers any word within the prompt as something you would like to see generated in the final image. Prompting still life gouache painting without any fruit or still life gouache painting dont add fruit! are more likely to produce pictures that include fruits because the relationship between &quot;without&quot; or &quot;don't&quot; and the &quot;fruit&quot; is not interpreted by the Midjourney Bot in the same way a human reader would understand it. To improve your results, focus your prompt on what you do want to see in the image and use the &quot;--no&quot; parameter to specify concepts you don't want to include.</p>
<p>still life gouache painting</p>
<p>a range of objects appear in the still life</p>
<p>still life gouache painting don't add fruit</p>
<p>more fruit is present in the final image.</p>
<p>Multi Prompting</p>
<p>The --no parameter is the same as weighing part of a multi prompt to &quot;-.5&quot; still life gouache painting:: fruit::-.5 is the same as still life gouache painting --no fruit.</p>
<p>How to Use the No Paramter</p>
<p>Add --no item1, item2, item3 to the end of your prompt.</p>

The --chaos or --c parameter influences how varied the initial image grids are. High --chaos values will produce more unusual and unexpected results and compositions. Lower --chaos values have more reliable, repeatable results.</p>
<p>--chaos accepts values 0–100.
The default --chaos value is 0.</p>
<p>The Influence of Chaos on Jobs
No --chaos value</p>
<p>Using a very low --chaos value, or not specifying a value, will produce initial image grids that are similar each time a Job is run.</p>
<p>prompt example: /imagine prompt: watermelon owl hybrid --c 0</p>
<p>Low --chaos values</p>
<p>Using a low --chaos value will produce initial image grids that are slightly varied each time a Job is run.</p>
<p>prompt example: /imagine prompt: watermelon owl hybrid --c 10</p>
<p>Moderate --chaos values</p>
<p>Using a moderate --chaos value will produce initial image grids that are varied each time a Job is run.</p>
<p>prompt example: /imagine prompt: watermelon owl hybrid --c 25</p>
<p>High --chaos Values</p>
<p>Using a higher --chaos value will produce initial image grids that are more varied and unexpected each time a Job is run.</p>
<p>prompt example: /imagine prompt: watermelon owl hybrid --c 50</p>
<p>Very High --chaos Values</p>
<p>Using extremely high --chaos values will produce initial image grids that are varied and have unexpected compositions or artistic mediums each time a Job is run.</p>
<p>prompt example: /imagine prompt: watermelon owl hybrid --c 80</p>
<p>How to Change the Chaos Value
Use the --chaos or --c Parameter</p>
<p>Add --chaos <value> or --c <value> to the end of your prompt.</p>

Aspect Ratios
Light
The --aspect or --ar parameter changes the aspect ratio of the generated image. An aspect ratio is the width-to-height ratio of an image. It is typically expressed as two numbers separated by a colon, such as 7:4 or 4:3.</p>
<p>A square image has equal width and height, described as a 1:1 aspect ratio. The image could be 1000px × 1000px, or 1500px × 1500px, and the aspect ratio would still be 1:1. A computer screen might have a ratio of 16:10. The width is 1.6 times longer than the height. So the image could be 1600px × 1000px, 4000px × 2000px, 320px x 200px, etc.</p>
<p>The default aspect ratio is 1:1.
--aspect must use whole numbers. Use 139:100 instead of 1.39:1.
The aspect ratio impacts the shape and composition of a generated image.
Some aspect ratios may be slightly changed when upscaling.</p>
<p>Max Aspect Ratios</p>
<p>Different Midjourney Version Models have different maximum aspect ratios.</p>
<pre><code>Version 5	Version 4	niji 5
</code></pre>
<p>Ratios	any*	1:2 to 2:1	any*</p>
<p>The --ar parameter will accept any aspect ratio from 1:1 (square) up to the maximum aspect ratio for each model. However, final outputs may be slightly modified during image generation or upscaling.</p>
<ul>
<li>Aspect ratios greater than 2:1 are experimental and may produce unpredicatble results.</li>
</ul>
<p>prompt example: imagine/ prompt vibrant california poppies --ar 5:4</p>
<p>Common Midjourney Aspect Ratios</p>
<p>--aspect 1:1 Default aspect ratio.
--aspect 5:4 Common frame and print ratio.
--aspect 3:2 Common in print photography.
--aspect 7:4 Close to HD TV screens and smartphone screens.</p>
<p>Changing the Aspect Ratio of an Image</p>
<p>Do you love an image you have generated but wish it taller or wider? You can use the 🔎 Zoom Out buttons on any upscaled image to change the aspect ratio of your image. The Midjourney Bot will fill in the new space with additional content informed by your prompt and the original image.</p>
<p>How to Set the Aspect Ratio
Use Aspect Ratio Parameters</p>
<p>Add --aspect <value>:<value>, or --ar <value>:<value> to the end of your prompt.</p>

The /shorten command analyzes your prompt, highlights some of your prompt's most influential words, and suggests unnecessary words you could remove. With this command, you can optimize your prompt by focusing on essential terms.</p>
<p>/shorten is not compatible with multi prompts or the --no parameter</p>
<p>Analyze a Prompt with /Shorten</p>
<p>The Midjourney bot analyzes your prompt by breaking it down into smaller units known as tokens. These tokens can be phrases, words, or even syllables. The Midjourney bot converts these tokens into a format it can understand. It uses them with the associations and patterns learned during its training to guide how your image is generated. Think of tokens as the building blocks that help the Midjourney bot make sense of the input and create the desired visual output.</p>
<p>Long prompts with unnecessary words, lengthy descriptions, poetic phrases, or direct addressing of the bot (&quot;Please make me an image,&quot; &quot;Thank you for your help, Midjourney Bot!&quot;) can lead to unexpected elements being added to your images.</p>
<p>The /shorten command can help you discover the most important words in your prompt and what words you can omit.</p>
<p>Shorten Command Example</p>
<p>If you want to create a pile of sprinkle covered donuts you might try the prompt:
Please create a whimsical majestic tower of donuts, intricately crafted and adorned with a mesmerizing array of colorful sprinkles. Bring this sugary masterpiece to life, ensuring every detail is rendered in stunning magical realism. Thank you!</p>
<p>If you use /shorten command with the above prompt the Midjourney Bot will return the following information:</p>
<p>IMPORTANT TOKENS
Please create a whimsical majestic tower of donuts, intricately crafted and adorned with a mesmerizing array of colorful sprinkles. Bring this sugary masterpiece to life, ensuring every detail is rendered in stunning magical realism. Thank you!</p>
<p>SHORTENED PROMPTS
1️⃣ Please, majestic tower of donuts, crafted, array of colorful sprinkles, sugary masterpiece, rendered, magical realism</p>
<p>2️⃣ Please, majestic tower of donuts, colorful sprinkles, sugary masterpiece, rendered, magical realism</p>
<p>3️⃣ majestic tower of donuts, colorful sprinkles, sugary, magical realism</p>
<p>4️⃣ majestic tower of donuts, colorful sprinkles, magical</p>
<p>5️⃣ tower of donuts, sprinkles</p>
<p>The most Important tokens in your prompt are highlighted in bold, the least important are stikethroughed. You will also be given 5 possible shorter prompts based on this information.</p>
<p>Shortened Option 1️⃣ </p>
<p>Please, majestic tower of donuts, crafted, array of colorful sprinkles, sugary masterpiece, rendered, magical realism</p>
<p>Shortened Option 2️⃣ </p>
<p>Please, majestic tower of donuts, colorful sprinkles, sugary masterpiece, rendered, magical realism</p>
<p>Shortened Option 3️⃣ </p>
<p>majestic tower of donuts, colorful sprinkles, sugary, magical realism</p>
<p>Shortened Option 4️⃣ </p>
<p>majestic tower of donuts, colorful sprinkles, magical</p>
<p>Shortened Option 5️⃣ </p>
<p>tower of donuts, sprinkles</p>
<p>Analyzing the Results</p>
<p>The shortest prompt, Option 5️⃣ : tower of donuts, sprinkles produced an image closest to the original goal. Many of the filler words like &quot;whimsical,&quot; &quot;mesmerizing,&quot; and &quot;masterpiece&quot; could be omitted. Learning that &quot;tower&quot; and &quot;magical&quot; were considered important tokens helps explain why some images were generated with fairytale castle elements. Learning this provided a clue that &quot;magical&quot; should be removed from the prompt if the goal was to create a stack of delicious donuts.</p>
<p>The /shorten command is a tool to help you explore how the Midjourney Bot interprets tokens and experiment with words, but it may not work for all subjects and styles of prompting.</p>
<p>How to Use Shorten</p>
<p>Use the /shorten <your prompt> command in any Bot Channel to get information on your prompt</p>

Parameters are options added to a prompt that change how an image generates. Parameters can change an image's Aspect Ratios, switch between Midjourney Model Versions, change which Upscaler is used, and lots more.</p>
<p>Parameters are always added to the end of a prompt. You can add multiple parameters to each prompt.</p>
<p>Using an Apple device?</p>
<p>Many Apple devices automatically change double hyphens (--) to an em-dash (—). Midjourney accepts both!</p>
<p>Basic Parameters
Aspect Ratios</p>
<p>--aspect, or --ar Change the aspect ratio of a generation.</p>
<p>Chaos</p>
<p>--chaos &lt;number 0–100&gt; Change how varied the results will be. Higher values produce more unusual and unexpected generations.</p>
<p>Fast</p>
<p>--fast override your current setting and run a single job using Fast Mode.</p>
<p>Image Weight</p>
<p>--iw &lt;0–2&gt; Sets image prompt weight relative to text weight. The default value is 1.</p>
<p>No</p>
<p>--no Negative prompting, --no plants would try to remove plants from the image.</p>
<p>Quality</p>
<p>--quality &lt;.25, .5, or 1&gt;, or --q &lt;.25, .5, or 1&gt; How much rendering quality time you want to spend. The default value is 1. Higher values use more GPU minutes; lower values use less.</p>
<p>Random</p>
<p>--style random, add a random 32 base styles Style Tuner code to your prompt. You can also use --style random-16, --style random-64 or --style random-128 to use random results from other lengths of Style Tuners.</p>
<p>Relax</p>
<p>--relax override your current setting and run a single job using Relax Mode.</p>
<p>Repeat</p>
<p>--repeat &lt;1–40&gt;, or --r &lt;1–40&gt; Create multiple Jobs from a single prompt. --repeat is useful for quickly rerunning a job multiple times.</p>
<p>Seed</p>
<p>--seed &lt;integer between 0–4294967295&gt; The Midjourney bot uses a seed number to create a field of visual noise, like television static, as a starting point to generate the initial image grids. Seed numbers are generated randomly for each image but can be specified with the --seed or --sameseed parameter. Using the same seed number and prompt will produce similar ending images.</p>
<p>Stop</p>
<p>--stop &lt;integer between 10–100&gt; Use the --stop parameter to finish a Job partway through the process. Stopping a Job at an earlier percentage can create blurrier, less detailed results.</p>
<p>Style</p>
<p>--style <raw> Switch between versions of the Midjourney Model Version 5.1 and 5.2.
--style &lt;4a, 4b, or 4c&gt; Switch between versions of the Midjourney Model Version 4.
--style &lt;cute, expressive, original, or scenic&gt; Switch between versions of the Niji Model Version 5.
Use the /tune command to create a Style Tuner and generate custom style codes.</p>
<p>Stylize</p>
<p>--stylize <number>, or --s <number> parameter influences how strongly Midjourney's default aesthetic style is applied to Jobs.</p>
<p>Tile</p>
<p>--tile parameter generates images that can be used as repeating tiles to create seamless patterns.</p>
<p>Turbo</p>
<p>--turbo override your current setting and run a single job using Turbo Mode.</p>

The /settings command provides toggle buttons for common options like model version, style value, quality value, and upscaler version. Settings also has toggles for the /stealth and /public commands.</p>
<p>Parameters added to the end of a prompt will override selections made using /settings.</p>
<p>Model Version Dropdown</p>
<p>Select the Midjourney Model Version to use when generating images. Use The Latest Model is the default selection and will always use the newest Midjourney Model Version.</p>
<p>Use the latest Model (V5.2) 5️⃣ Mjourney Model V5.2 5️⃣ Mjourney Model V5.1 🍎 Niji Model V5 5️⃣ Mjourney Model V5.0 🌈 Niji Model V4 4️⃣ Mjourney Model V4 3️⃣ Mjourney Model V3 2️⃣ Mjourney Model V2 1️⃣ Mjourney Model V1</p>
<p>Style Raw Parameter</p>
<p>Midjourney Model Versions 5.1 and 5.2 can be fine-tuned with the --style raw parameter to reduce the Midjourney default aesthetic. This toggle is not available if other model versions are selected.</p>
<p>🔧 Raw Mode</p>
<p>Stylize Parameter</p>
<p>The Midjourney Bot has been trained to produce images that favor artistic color, composition, and forms. The --stylize or --s parameter influences how strongly this training is applied. Low stylization values produce images that closely match the prompt but are less artistic. High stylization values create images that are very artistic but less connected to the prompt.</p>
<p>🖌️ Stylize Low 🖌️ Stylize Med 🖌️ Stylize High 🖌️ Stylize Very High</p>
<p>Stylize Low = --s 50, Stylize Med = --s 100, Stylize High = --s 250, Stylize Very High = --s 750,</p>

<p>High and Low Variation Mode</p>
<p>Toggle between High Variation and Low Variation mode.</p>
<p>🎨 High Variation Mode 🎨 Low Variation Mode</p>
<p>Sticky Style</p>

The /blend command allows you to upload 2–5 images quickly and then looks at the concepts and aesthetics of each image and merges them into a novel new image.</p>
<p>/blend is the same as using multiple image prompts with /imagine, but the interface is optimized for easy use on mobile devices.
/blend works with up to 5 images. To use more than 5 images in a prompt use image prompts with /imagine
/blend does not work with text prompts. To use text and image prompts together, use image prompts and text with /imagine</p>
<p>/blend Options</p>
<p>After typing the /blend command, you will be prompted to upload two photos. Drag and drop images from your hard drive or add images from your photo library when using a mobile device. To add more images, select the optional/options field and select image3, image4, or image5. The /blend command may take longer to start than other commands because your images must be uploaded before the Midjourney Bot can process your request.</p>
<p>Blended images have a default 1:1 aspect ratio, but you can use the optional dimensions field to select between a square aspect ratio (1:1), portrait aspect ration (2:3), or landscape aspect ratio (3:2).</p>
<p>Custom suffixes are added to the end of /blend prompts, like any other /imagine prompt. Aspect ratios specified as part of the /blend command override aspect ratios within a custom suffix.</p>
<p>Blending Tip</p>
<p>For the best results, upload images that are the same aspect ratio as your desired result.</p>

<p>U1 U2 U3 U4 buttons separate an image from the image grid, allowing you easily download that image or use additional tools like Zoom Out, or Pan.</p>
<p>When using legacy Midjourney model versions the U buttons would upscale an image generating a larger version of the selected image and adding more details, which uses Fast GPU time.</p>

Midjourney routinely releases new model versions to improve efficiency, coherency, and quality. The latest model is the default, but other models can be used by adding the --version or --v parameter or by using the /settings command and selecting a model version. Each model excels at producing different types of images.</p>
<p>--version accepts the values 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 5.1, and 5.2
--version can be abbreviated --v
--v 5.2 is the current default model.</p>
<p>Model Version 5.2</p>
<p>The Midjourney V5.2 model is the newest and most advanced, released June 2023. To use this model, add the --v 5.2 parameter to the end of a prompt, or use the /settings command and select 5️⃣ MJ Version 5.2</p>
<p>Default Model 06/22/23–current</p>
<p>This model produces more detailed, sharper results with better colors, contrast, and compositions. It also has a slightly better understanding of prompts than earlier models and is more responsive to the full range of the --stylize parameter.</p>
<p>Prompt: vibrant California poppies --v 5.2
Prompt: high contrast surreal collage --v 5.2</p>
<p>Model Version 5.2 + Style Raw Parameter</p>
<p>Midjourney Model Versions 5.1 and 5.2 can be fine-tuned with the --style raw parameter to reduce the Midjourney default aesthetic.</p>
<p>Read more about the Midjourney --style parameter.</p>
<p>default --v 5.2</p>
<p>vibrant California poppies</p>
<p>--v 5.2 --style raw</p>
<p>vibrant California poppies --style raw</p>
<p>default --v 5.2</p>
<p>high contrast surreal collage</p>
<p>--v 5.2 --style raw</p>
<p>high contrast surreal collage --style raw</p>
<p>Model Version 5.1</p>
<p>The Midjourney V5.1 was released on May 4th, 2023. To use this model, add the --v 5.1 parameter to the end of a prompt, or use the /settings command and select 5️⃣ MJ Version 5.1</p>
<p>Default Model 05/03/23–06/22/23</p>
<p>This model has a stronger default aesthetic than earlier versions, making it easier to use with simple text prompts. It also has high Coherency, excels at accurately interpreting natural language prompts, produces fewer unwanted artifacts and borders, has increased image sharpness, and supports advanced features like repeating patterns with --tile.</p>
<p>Prompt: vibrant California poppies --v 5.1
Prompt: high contrast surreal collage --v 5.1</p>
<p>Model Version 5.0</p>
<p>The Midjourney V5.0 model produces more photographic generations than the V5.1 model. This model produces images that closely match the prompt but may require longer prompts to achieve your desired aesthetic.</p>
<p>Default Model 03/30/23–05/03/23</p>
<p>To use this model, add the --v 5 parameter to the end of a prompt, or use the /settings command and select 5️⃣ MJ Version 5</p>
<p>Prompt: vibrant California poppies --v 5
Prompt: high contrast surreal collage --v 5</p>
<p>Model Version 4</p>
<p>The Midjourney V4 was the default model from Nov 2022–May 2023. This model featured an entirely new codebase and brand-new AI architecture designed by Midjourney and trained on the new Midjourney AI supercluster. Model Version 4 had increased knowledge of creatures, places, and objects compared to previous models.</p>
<p>This model has very high Coherency and excels with Image Prompts.</p>
<p>Prompt: vibrant California poppies
Prompt: high contrast surreal collage</p>
<p>Niji Model 5</p>
<p>The Niji model is a collaboration between Midjourney and Spellbrush tuned to produce anime and illustrative styles with vastly more knowledge of anime, anime styles, and anime aesthetics. It's excellent at dynamic and action shots and character-focused compositions.</p>
<p>To use this model, add the --niji 5 parameter to the end of a prompt, or use the /settings command and select 🍏 Niji version 5</p>
<p>This model is sensitive to the --stylize parameter. Experiment with different stylization ranges to fine-tune your images.</p>
<p>Niji Style Parameters</p>
<p>Niji Model Version 5 can also be fine-tuned with --style parameters to achieve unique looks. Try --style cute, --style scenic, --style original (uses the original Niji Model Version 5, which was the default before May 26th, 2023), or --style expressive.</p>
<p>default --niji 5</p>

The current Midjourney and Niji Model Versions produce grids of 1024 x 1024 pixel images. Use the U1 U2 U3 U4 buttons under each image grid to separate your selected image. You can then use the Upscale (2x) or Upscale (4x) tools to increase the size of your image.</p>
<p>Upscale tools use your subscription's GPU minutes. Using Upscale 2X on an image takes roughly twice as long as generating an initial image grid. Using Upscale 4X on an image takes roughly six times as long as generating an initial image grid.</p>
<p>Upscale tools are not compatible with the pan tool or the tile parameter.</p>
<p>How to Use the Upscale Tools</p>

Combine Remix Mode and the Midjourney Vary Region editor to select and regenerate specific parts of an upscaled image using a new or modified prompt.</p>
<p>This tool requires you to use up-to-date Discord client versions, if you do not see the Vary Region button, try updating your Discord client.</p>
<p>The Vary (Region) button appears after a Midjourney image has been upscaled.
Regional variations results are guided by the content in your original image, the area you select, and the modified prompt used.
Vary (Region) is compatible with Midjourney Model Versions V5.0, V5.1, V5.2, and niji 5</p>
<p>How to Use Remix Mode with Vary (Region)</p>

The size of your selection will affect your results. Larger selections give the Midjourney Bot more room to generate new creative details. Smaller selections will result in smaller, more subtle changes.
Note: You cannot edit an existing selection but can undo multiple steps using the undo button in the upper right corner.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Modify Your Prompt</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Describe what you want to generate in the selected areas with an updated prompt. Your revised prompt should focus on the details you want to introduce or change.</p>

<p>Vary Region + Remix Prompting Tips</p>
<p>Selections The size of your selection affects the outcome. Larger selections provide the Midjourney Bot with more contextual information, which can improve the scaling and context of new additions. But selecting too much may lead to the newly generated elements blending or replacing parts of the original image you wished to preserve.</p>
<p>Prompts Experiment with how you modify your prompt when Using Vary Region + Remix Mode. Prompts should focus on what you want to happen in the selected area. The Midjourney Bot also considers the existing image when generating a selected area, so shorter focused prompts often are more effective. Midjourney Prompts should not be conversational. Instead of &quot;Please change the meadow trail into a beautiful stream,&quot; be direct and prompt &quot;meadow stream.&quot;</p>
<p>Work in Small Steps If you want to change many parts of an image, work on one part at a time. This way, you can create a focused prompt for each part.</p>
<p>Vary Region + Remix Examples</p>
<p>Original Image</p>
<p>Prompt: gouache alligator in sunglasses</p>
<p>Selection</p>
<p>Updated Prompt: gouache alligator in green sunglasses</p>

Create subtle or strong variations of a generated image using the the V1 V2 V3 V4 buttons under each image grid, or use the Vary (Strong) and Vary (Subtle) buttons under an upscaled image.</p>
<p>Control the amount of variation created with these buttons using the 🎨 High Variation Mode and 🎨 Low Variation Mode settings. You can also create variations of upscaled images using the 🪄 Vary (Strong) or 🪄 Vary (Subtle) buttons that appear under upscaled images. 🪄 Vary (Region) modifies a selected area within a generated image without changing the entire image. Read more about Vary Region</p>
<p>🎨 High Variation Mode and 🎨 Low Variation Mode affect Remix Mode
🎨 High Variation Mode is the default setting.
🪄 Vary (Strong) and 🪄 Vary (Subtle) are availabe with Model Version 5.2 and Niji 5. Older models have a single 🪄 Make Variations button.</p>
<p>Variation Comparison</p>
<p>With 🎨 High Variation Mode and 🪄 Vary (Strong), Using the Variation buttons will produce a new images that may change the composition, number of elements, colors, and the type of details within the image. High Variation Mode is useful for creating multiple concepts based on a single generated image.</p>
<p>🎨 Low Variation Mode and 🪄 Vary (Subtle) produce variations that retain the main composition of the original image but introduce subtle changes to its details. This mode helps refine or make slight adjustments to an image.</p>
<p>Prompt example: imagine/ prompt mosaic estuary</p>

Prompts
Light
A Prompt is a short text phrase that the Midjourney Bot interprets to produce an image. The Midjourney Bot breaks down the words and phrases in a prompt into smaller pieces, called tokens, that can be compared to its training data and then used to generate an image. A well-crafted prompt can help make unique and exciting images.
Basic Prompts</p>
<p>A basic prompt can be as simple as a single word, phrase or emoji</p>
<p>Prompting Tip!</p>
<p>The Midjourney Bot works best with simple, short sentences that describe what you want to see. Avoid long lists of requests. Instead of: Show me a picture of lots of blooming California poppies, make them bright, vibrant orange, and draw them in an illustrated style with colored pencils Try: Bright orange California poppies drawn with colored pencils</p>
<p>Advanced Prompts</p>
<p>More advanced prompts can include one or more image URLs, multiple text phrases, and one or more parameters</p>
<p>Image Prompts</p>
<p>Image URLs can be added to a prompt to influence the style and content of the finished result. Image URLs always go at the front of a prompt.</p>
<p>Read more about Image Prompts</p>
<p>Prompt Text</p>
<p>The text description of what image you want to generate. See below for prompting information and tips. Well-written prompts help generate amazing images.</p>
<p>Parameters</p>
<p>Parameters change how an image generates. Parameters can change aspect ratios, models, upscalers, and lots more. Parameters go at the end of the prompt.</p>
<p>Read more about Parameters</p>
<p>Prompting Notes
Prompt Length</p>
<p>Prompts can be very simple. Single words (or even an emoji!) will produce an image. Very short prompts will rely heavily on Midjourney’s default style, so a more descriptive prompt is better for a unique look. However, super-long prompts aren’t always better. Concentrate on the main concepts you want to create.</p>
<p>Grammar</p>
<p>The Midjourney Bot does not understand grammar, sentence structure, or words like humans. Word choice also matters. More specific synonyms work better in many circumstances. Instead of big, try gigantic, enormous, or immense. Remove words when possible. Fewer words mean each word has a more powerful influence. Use commas, brackets, and hyphens to help organize your thoughts, but know the Midjourney Bot will not reliably interpret them. The Midjourney Bot does not consider capitalization.</p>
<p>Midjourney Model Version 4 is slightly better than other models at interpreting traditional sentence structure.</p>
<p>Focus on What you Want</p>
<p>It is better to describe what you want instead of what you don’t want. If you ask for a party with “no cake,” your image will probably include a cake. If you want to ensure an object is not in the final image, try advance prompting using the --no parameter.</p>
<p>Think About What Details Matter</p>
<p>Anything left unsaid may surprise you. Be as specific or vague as you want, but anything you leave out will be randomized. Being vague is a great way to get variety, but you may not get the specific details you want.</p>
<p>Try to be clear about any context or details that are important to you. Think about:</p>
<p>Subject: person, animal, character, location, object, etc.
Medium: photo, painting, illustration, sculpture, doodle, tapestry, etc.
Environment: indoors, outdoors, on the moon, in Narnia, underwater, the Emerald City, etc.
Lighting: soft, ambient, overcast, neon, studio lights, etc
Color: vibrant, muted, bright, monochromatic, colorful, black and white, pastel, etc.
Mood: Sedate, calm, raucous, energetic, etc.
Composition: Portrait, headshot, closeup, birds-eye view, etc.</p>
<p>Use Collective Nouns</p>
<p>Plural words leave a lot to chance. Try specific numbers. &quot;Three cats&quot; is more specific than &quot;cats.&quot; Collective nouns also work, “flock of birds” instead of &quot;birds.”</p>

Midjourney is an open-by-default community. To keep the platform accessible and welcoming to the broadest number of users, content must be PG-13.
Be kind and respect each other and staff. Do not create images or use text prompts that are inherently disrespectful, aggressive, or otherwise abusive. Violence or harassment of any kind will not be tolerated.
No adult content or gore. Please avoid making visually shocking or disturbing content. We will block some text inputs automatically.
Do not publicly repost the creations of others without their permission.
Be careful about sharing. It’s OK to share your creations outside of the Midjourney community, but please consider how others might view your content.
Any violations of these rules may lead to bans from our services. We are not a democracy. Behave respectfully or lose your rights to use the Service.</p>
<p>These rules apply to all content, including images made in private servers, using Private Mode, and in direct messages with the Midjourney Bot. See the Discord #rules channel for the most up-to-date information.</p>
<p>Notes
What is Considered Gore?</p>
<p>Gore includes images of detached body parts of humans or animals, cannibalism, blood, violence (images of shooting or bombing someone, for instance), deformed bodies, severed limbs, pestilence, etc.</p>
<p>What's NSFW or Adult Content?</p>
<p>Avoid nudity, sexual organs, fixation on naked breasts, people in showers or on toilets, sexual imagery, fetishes, etc.</p>
<p>Other Offensive Content</p>
<p>Other things may be deemed offensive or abusive because they can be viewed as racist, homophobic, disturbing, or in some way derogatory to a community. This includes offensive or inflamatory images of celebrities or public figures. Content guidelines are continually reviewed and may be modified as the Midjourney community grows.</p>
<p>About the Community Standards</p>
<p>Finding a balance between facilitating artistic expression and creating a safe and welcoming community for a broad group of users is challenging. Everyone has a right to an opinion about what images are beautiful, intriguing, or inspiring, and there are as many individual interpretations of what content is offensive, inappropriate, or harmful. We also recognize that art has a long history of pushing the status quo to challenge social conventions, inspire discussion, and spark change.</p>
<p>When deciding on our community guidelines for Midjourney, we considered many factors. As a new and rapidly developing technology, it is important to consider how the broader public will perceive and be introduced to this technology. Midjourney is a more participatory image-making tool than a paintbrush or pencil. The Midjourney team does not wish to participate in creating pornographic, offensive, or harmful images. Most important, however, was our desire to create a welcoming and inclusive community for all users. To that end, we have established guidelines prohibiting certain behaviors and language on our platform.</p>
<p>We understand that the balance we decided on may not be popular with everyone. Still, we hope you will respect our efforts to create a positive and supportive community for all. We encourage you to express yourself creatively but to do so in a way that is respectful and considerate of others.</p>
<p>Users who repeatedly violate the terms of service may be warned by a community moderator, given a time-out from accessing the bot, or be blocked from the service.</p>
<p>Self-Policing and Reporting</p>
<p>Occasionally prompts will unintentionally produce non-PG-13 content. Please self-police these images by using the ❌ emoji reaction or by right-clicking selecting Apps and then clicking Cancel Job to delete the image.</p>
<p>Users may flag any image for moderator review by right-clicking selecting Apps, and then clicking Report Job within Discord or the website by selecting ... under an image and clicking Report.</p>
<p>Report Images in Discord
Report Images on the Website</p>
<p>Automation</p>
<p>In order to maintain the highest quality experience for all users, Midjourney accounts are designed for individual use and each user may maintain only one account. Midjourney does not provide an API to access the bot through third-party apps or scripts, and automating interactions with the Midjourney Bot is strictly prohibited according to our Terms of Service. Accounts who do not comply with these rules may be blocked.</p>

<ol start="4">
<li>Go to any #General or #Newbie Channel</li>
</ol>
<p>After joining the Midjourney server on Discord, you'll see several channels listed in the sidebar.</p>
<p>On the Midjourney Server</p>
<p>Locate and select any channel labeled general-# or newbie-#. These channels are designed for beginners to start using the Midjourney bot. The Midjourney Bot will not generate images in other channels.</p>
<p>On Other Servers</p>
<p>You can generate images with the Midjourney Bot on any Discord server that has invited the Midjourney Bot. Look for instructions on your server on where to use the Bot.</p>
<p>5. Use the /imagine Command</p>
<p>About Discord Commands
Interact with the Midjourney Bot on Discord using a Command. Commands are used to create images, change default settings, monitor user info, and perform other helpful tasks. The /imagine command generates a unique image from a short text description (known as a Prompt). Learn more about Prompts</p>
<p>How to Use /imagine</p>
<p>Type '/imagine prompt:' in the message field. You can also select the /imagine command from the list of available slash commands that pop up when you type '/'.
Type a description of the image you want to create in the prompt field.
Send your message. The Bot will interpret your text prompt and begin generating the images.
Respect the Community Guidelines. Community guidelines apply wherever the Midjourney Bot is used.</p>
<p>6. Accept the Terms Of Service</p>
<p>Before generating any images, the Midjourney Bot will prompt you to accept the Terms Of Service. You must agree to these terms to proceed with image creation.</p>
<p>7. Image Generation Process</p>
<p>After submitting a text prompt, the Midjourney Bot processes your request, creating four unique image options within a minute. This process utilizes advanced Graphics Processing Units (GPUs), and each image generation counts towards the GPU time included with your Midjourney subscription. To monitor your available GPU time (Fast Time Remaining) use the /info command.</p>
<p>8. Select an Image or Create Variations</p>
<p>Once your initial image grid has been generated, two rows of buttons become available underneath your image grid.</p>
<p>U1 U2 U3 U4 Image Selection</p>
<p>In earlier versions of Midjourney, the U buttons were used for upscaling images. With the latest model, images are immediately generated at 1024 x 1024 pixels size. Now, the 'U' buttons help you separate out your chosen image from the grid, making it easier to download and giving you access to additional editing and generation tools.</p>
<p>🔄 Re-run or Re-roll a Job</p>
<p>The 🔄 button re-runs a Job. In this case, it would re-run the original prompt producing a new grid of images.</p>
<p>V1 V2 V3 V4 Image Variation</p>
<p>The V buttons are used to create variations of the selected image. Each button generates a new image grid that maintains the general style and composition of the selected image.</p>
<p>9. Enhance or Modify Your Image</p>
<p>After singling out an image, an expanded set of options becomes available.</p>
<p>🪄 Vary (Strong) 🪄 Vary (Subtle)</p>
<p>Create a stronger or subtle variation of your selected image, generating a new grid of four options.</p>
<p>🔍 Zoom Out 2x 🔍 Zoom Out 1.5x 🔍 Custom Zoom</p>
<p>Zoom Out of your image, extending the canvas its original boundaries without changing the content of the original image. The newly expanded canvas will be filled-in using guidance from the prompt and the original image.</p>
<p>⬅️ ➡️ ⬆️ ⬇️</p>
<p>The Pan buttons allow you to expand the canvas of an image in a chosen direction without changing the content of the original image. The newly expanded canvas will be filled in using guidance from the prompt and the original image.</p>
