The arbitral award will be final and binding on the parties and its execution may be presented in any competent court, including any court with jurisdiction over either party or any of its property.\nEach party will bear its own lawyers’ and experts’ fees and expenses, regardless of the arbitrator’s final decision regarding the Dispute.\n\n7.

Additional information and policies regarding our subscription plans, including details on billing, taxes, refunds, and authorization, can be found here.\n\n9.

When you purchase a subscription to Midjourney, you are purchasing time on these GPUs.\n\nDifferent subscription plans have different amounts of monthly GPU time.\nThis monthly subscription GPU time is Fast Mode time. Fast Mode tries to give you access to a GPU instantly. It's the default processing tier and uses your subscription's monthly GPU time.\n\n\n\n\nHow many GPU minutes do my generations cost?\n\nThe Average Job the Midjourney bot processes takes about one minute of GPU time to finish creating an image. Upscaling an image, using nonstandard aspect ratios, or older Midjourney Model Versions may take more time. Creating variations or using lower quality values will take less time.\n\nA Job's time depends on the following factors:\n\n\t+ Lower Time\t++ Average Time\t+++ Higher Time\nJob Type\tVariations\t/imagine\tUpscale\nAspect Ratio\tdefault (square)\ttall or wide\t\nQuality Parameter\t--q 0.25 or --q 0.5\tdefault (--q 1)\t--q 2 (for legacy Model Versions\nStop Parameter\t--stop 10–--stop 99\tdefault (--stop 100)\t\n\n\n\n\nUse /info before and after running a process to see how many of your remaining GPU minutes the generation used.\n\n\n\n\nFast vs. Relax Mode\n\nSubscribers to the Standard, Pro, and Mega plans can create an unlimited number of images each month in Relax Mode. Relax Mode will not cost any GPU time, but Jobs will be placed into a queue based on how much you've used the system.\n\nHow long do I need to wait in Relax mode?\n\nJobs in Relax mode are placed in a queue to be processed as GPUs become available. Wait times for Relax are dynamic but generally range between 0–10 minutes per job. If you use Relax mode occasionally, you will have shorter wait times compared to subscribers that have used it more. This priority currently resets whenever you renew your monthly subscription.\n\nLimitations\n\nPermutation prompts, the --repeat parameter and the Legacy upscaler, Max Upscale are not available while useing Relax mode.\n\nRun Out of Fast Time?\n\nYou can purchase more Fast Hours on your Midjourney.com/accounts page.\n\nBy default, images are generated using Fast Mode.\nUnused monthly Fast GPU time does not roll over.\nFast Mode is automatically reactivated when the subscription renews.\n\n\n\n\nTurbo Mode\n\nTurbo Mode is available for subscribers who want extremely quick image generation. Turbo mode uses a high-speed experimental GPU pool. Jobs run in Turbo mode generate up to four times faster but consume twice as many subscription GPU minutes as a typical Fast Mode Job.\n\nTurbo mode is only available with Midjourney Model Versions 5, 5.1, and 5.2.\n\nIf Turbo mode is selected, but the GPUs are unavailable, or it is incompatible with the selected model version, your job will run in Fast Mode instead.\n\nTurbo Mode is an experimental feature, and availability and price may change at any time.\n\n\n\n\nHow to Switch Between Modes\nUse the /fast /turbo or /relax command\n\nStandard, Pro, and Mega plan subscribers can use the /fast or /relax commands to switch between modes.\n\n\n\n\nUse the Settings Command\n\nUse the /settings command and choose 🐢 Relax 🐇 Fast or ⚡ Turbo from the menu.\n\n\n\n\nUse the --fast --turbo or --relax parameter\n\nStandard, Pro, and Mega plan subscribers can use the --relax, --fast, or --turbo parameters at the end of a prompt to run a single job using Relax, Fast, or Turbo mode instead of changing their preferred setting.\n\nPrevious\nEarn Free Hours\nNext\nContacting Support\nMidjourney is an independent research lab exploring new mediums of thought and expanding the imaginative powers of the human species.

An aspect ratio is the width-to-height ratio of an image.

The image could be 1000px × 1000px, or 1500px × 1500px, and the aspect ratio would still be 1:1. A computer screen might have a ratio of 16:10. The width is 1.6 times longer than the height. So the image could be 1600px × 1000px, 4000px × 2000px, 320px x 200px, etc.\n\nThe default aspect ratio is 1:1.\n--aspect must use whole numbers.

Many people use words like resolution, file size, pixel count, dots per inch, and high resolution interchangeably. Understanding what these words mean can help you get the results you want from Midjourney images.\n\nThis guide is a simplified, non-technical explanation of image size, dimensions, resolutions, and DPI.\n\nImage Size Basics\n\nExamples will use this simple sailboat picture.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat is an image file?\n\nImage files like .jpg, .png, or .gif are instructions for creating an image.\nEach image is a mosaic of small colored tiles (pixels) that form the picture.\n\nThink about image files as a set of instructions on how to arrange colored pixels to create an image.\n\n\n\n\nWhat is File Size?\n\nThe file size is directly related to the amount of information inside the file. In the boat picture, the file contains 10 rows and 10 columns, or 100 pieces of information. If each colored dot is one byte of information, the image file would be 100 bytes.\n\nIf the file has a grid of 200 x 400 pieces of color information, it would be an 80,000-byte file (200*400=80,000) or 80,000-byte/1000 = 80-kilobyte file.\n\n\n\n\nImage Dimensions\n\nPeople generally don't talk about the file size of an image in kilobytes or megabytes. They talk about the image's dimensions (the number of columns and rows information) The boat.jpg example above is a 10x10 pixel image. 1024x1024, 720p, and 4K are all shorthand ways of talking about the pixel dimensions of an image.\n​\nThere are no \"high-resolution\" image files when working on monitors, phones, TVs, or other screens. The only thing that matters is how much information you have (the image dimensions) vs. the size of the display.\nThe boat.jpg image might be a great size on a vintage flip phone, fine on your tablet, and not enough for your brand-new monitor.\n\nThe same image dimension viewed on different screens.\n\nDPI Dots Per Inch\n\nDots Per Inch, Pixels Per Inch, Dots Per Centimeter, and Points Per Inch all refer to generally the same concept. The amount of information in a given length. 300 \"dots\" per inch means there are 300 pieces of color information (pixels, printed CMYK dots, etc.) in each inch.\nDPI is NOT a measurement that is useful on screens. The dimensions of the file are what matters on screen. DPI is VERY important when printing. The general standard for a great-looking print is 300 dots of color in every inch. 300DPI is the point where the individual dots are so closely packed together you can't distinguish individual dots, and the picture looks smooth and crisp.\n\nWhat DPI is this file?\n\nIt depends! Knowing that your file only contains instructions on how to make an image, the DPI is only determined when you tell the printer how closely or loosely that information is packed together.\nThink about building the file with Legos. You can take the same set of instructions, and if you have a pile of small 1x1 bricks, you pack your information into a smaller space than if you start with a pile of 2x2 bricks.\n\nThe same \"file instructions\" using two sizes of tiles.\n\nA Simplified Example of the Math\n\nFor this example, you have a 1200x1200 pixel image. What DPI is that image? It depends on how large you want it to print out.\n1200/300 = 4. A 1200x1200 pixel image would produce a great looking 4in x 4in image.\n1200/150 = 8. A 1200x1200 pixel image would produce an OK-looking 8in x 8in image.\n1200/100 = 12. A 1200x1200 pixel image would produce a pretty bad looking 12in x 12in image.\n\nMidjourney Image Sizes\n\nThe default size of a Midjourney image using the current default Model Version is 1024 x 1024 pixels. You can use the upscale tool, to increase the file size to 2048 x 2048 or 4096 x 4096 pixels. Using other aspect ratios will produce images with different dimensions but the same general file size.\n\nOpen your Midjourney images in your web browser or download them from Midjourney.com for maximum file size.\n\n\n\n\nCan You Print a Midjourney Image?\n\nAbsolutely! The quality of your print simply follows the above rules of DPI. If you want a quality print, you need 300 pieces of information in every inch. So the default 1024x1024 pixel midjourney image would produce a good quality 3.4 in x 3.4 in print (1024 / 300 = 3.41). An image that has been upscaled to 4096x4096 pixels would produce a good quality 13.7 in x 13.7 in print (4096 / 300 = 13.65)\n\nPrevious\nUpscalers\nNext\nZoom Out\nMidjourney is an independent research lab exploring new mediums of thought and expanding the imaginative powers of the human species.

Generate Your Custom Style Tuner\n\nCreate a Style Tuner page using the /tune command.\n\n\n\n\n2. Select Your Preferred Options\nStyle Directions: Choose the number of image pairs you want to see in your Style Tuner (16, 32, 64, or 128 pairs).\nDefault Mode: Select the style mode for your sample images (Default or Raw). If you typically do not use the --style raw parameter with your prompts, choose \"default.\"\n\nUse an Exisiting Style Tuner\n\nIf another user has previously generated a Style Tuner with your prompt, you will receive a link to that Tuner. Click the link to access the existing Style Tuner. Using a previously generated Style Tuner does not use your subscription's GPU minutes.\n\n\n\n\n3. Submit your Job\nClick the Submit button.\nConfirm your submission.\n\nYour Style Tuner generates a pair of images for each Style Direction. A Style Tuner with 16 directions will generate 32 images. A Style Tuner with 128 directions will generate 256 images. Generating these images uses your subscription's Fast GPU time.\n\n\n\n\n4. Open Your Custom Style Tuner\nWhen your Style Tuner is ready, the Midjourney Bot will send you a direct message with a link to your Tuner.\nClick the link to open your Style Tuner in your web browser.\n\nTry this Style Tuner: https://tuner.midjourney.com/ejYLCOY\n\n\n\n\n5.

Generate an Image\nReturn to Discord\nUse the /imagine command and paste your copied prompt and --style <code> parameter into the prompt field.\nGenerate your image\n\n\n\n\n8. Use Additional Midjourney Tools\n\nTake your image further by using other Midjourney tools like Upscale, Pan, Zoom-Out, Remix, or Vary-Region.\n\n\n\n\n9. Experiment and Explore\nUse your style code with a new prompt:\n\nThe Style Tuner you create uses your initial prompt to create sample images and help you visualize the impact of your choices. However, the generated codes can be used with any prompt. Remember that styles and prompts always work together to generate an image, so a style code may not transfer as intended to other prompts.\n\nExperiment: Style codes and prompts interact in complex ways. A code may have a strong effect on one prompt and a subtle effect on a similar prompt. The images you choose in your Style Tuner can combine in unexpected and creative ways. Use style codes as a tool to explore new looks and visuals.\nGenerate more codes: You can return to your Style Tuner page at any time to change your selections and create new codes.\nShare style codes: You can share or use style codes created by friends. Check out the Midjourney style-tuner channel to share your codes and discover new styles!\nFind a Style Tuner page: Find the Style Tuner page for any style code by adding it to this URL: https://tuner.midjourney.com/code/StyleCodeHere.\n\n\n\n\n10. Save and Reuse Your Codes\nUse the /settings command and turn on 📌Sticky Style. Sticky Style will save the last --style parameter used in your personal suffix, so you don't have to repeat the code on future prompts. Change codes by using a new --style or unselecting 📌Sticky Style.\nUse custom options to store your favorite codes.\nOr, create your own Discord server to organize your images, prompts, image references, and Style Tuner codes.\n\n\n\n\nStyle Tune Examples\n\nprompt vibrant california poppies\nAll images were made by style created using this Style Tuner\n\n\n\n\nRandom Codes\n\nUse the --style random parameter to apply a random 32 base styles Style Tuner code to your prompt. You can also use --style random-16, --style random-64 or --style random-128 to use random results from other lengths of tuners.\n\n--random simulates Style Tuner code with random selections chosen for 75% of the image pairs. You can adjust this percentage by adding a number to the end of the --random parameter. For example, --style random-32-15 simulates a 32-pair tuner with 15% of the image pairs selected, --style random-128-80 simulates a 128-pair tuner with 80% of the image pairs selected.\n\n\n\n\nCombine Codes\n\nCombine multiple codes in one parameter with a hyphen, --style code1-code2.\nCombine multiple codes and style raw: --style raw-code1-code2\n\n\n\n\nStyle Tuner and --stylize\n\nThe --stylize parameter adjusts the influence of the --style parameter on your generated images. If you're not seeing the desired effect from your code, consider combining it with higher stylization values, like --stylize 250, or --stylize 500.\n\nComparison\n\nprompt vibrant California poppies --style fdeQ4zOX5jd --stylize 250\n\n--stylize 20\n\n--stylize 100 (default)\n\n--stylize 250\n\n--stylize 750\n\n\n\n\nStyle Raw\n\nCombine your custom style code with Midjourney Style Raw by using --style raw-<code>.\nExample: To use Style Raw and --style fjo5S8BgMoV use --style raw-fjo5S8BgMoV.\n\n\n\n\nStyle Tuner and Niji Model Version\n\nStyle Tuner codes created with the Midjourney Bot are not compatible with the Niji Model version accessed through the Midjourney Bot.

Think of tokens as the building blocks that help the Midjourney bot make sense of the input and create the desired visual output.\n\nLong prompts with unnecessary words, lengthy descriptions, poetic phrases, or direct addressing of the bot (\"Please make me an image,\" \"Thank you for your help, Midjourney Bot!\") can lead to unexpected elements being added to your images.\n\nThe /shorten command can help you discover the most important words in your prompt and what words you can omit.\n\n\n\n\nShorten Command Example\n\nIf you want to create a pile of sprinkle covered donuts you might try the prompt:\nPlease create a whimsical majestic tower of donuts, intricately crafted and adorned with a mesmerizing array of colorful sprinkles. Bring this sugary masterpiece to life, ensuring every detail is rendered in stunning magical realism. Thank you!\n\nIf you use /shorten command with the above prompt the Midjourney Bot will return the following information:\n\nIMPORTANT TOKENS\nPlease create a whimsical majestic tower of donuts, intricately crafted and adorned with a mesmerizing array of colorful sprinkles. Bring this sugary masterpiece to life, ensuring every detail is rendered in stunning magical realism. Thank you!\n\nSHORTENED PROMPTS\n1️⃣ Please, majestic tower of donuts, crafted, array of colorful sprinkles, sugary masterpiece, rendered, magical realism\n\n2️⃣ Please, majestic tower of donuts, colorful sprinkles, sugary masterpiece, rendered, magical realism\n\n3️⃣ majestic tower of donuts, colorful sprinkles, sugary, magical realism\n\n4️⃣ majestic tower of donuts, colorful sprinkles, magical\n\n5️⃣ tower of donuts, sprinkles\n\nThe most Important tokens in your prompt are highlighted in bold, the least important are stikethroughed. You will also be given 5 possible shorter prompts based on this information.\n\n\n\nShortened Option 1️⃣ \n\nPlease, majestic tower of donuts, crafted, array of colorful sprinkles, sugary masterpiece, rendered, magical realism\n\nShortened Option 2️⃣ \n\nPlease, majestic tower of donuts, colorful sprinkles, sugary masterpiece, rendered, magical realism\n\nShortened Option 3️⃣ \n\nmajestic tower of donuts, colorful sprinkles, sugary, magical realism\n\nShortened Option 4️⃣ \n\nmajestic tower of donuts, colorful sprinkles, magical\n\nShortened Option 5️⃣ \n\ntower of donuts, sprinkles\n\n\n\nAnalyzing the Results\n\nThe shortest prompt, Option 5️⃣ : tower of donuts, sprinkles produced an image closest to the original goal. Many of the filler words like \"whimsical,\" \"mesmerizing,\" and \"masterpiece\" could be omitted. Learning that \"tower\" and \"magical\" were considered important tokens helps explain why some images were generated with fairytale castle elements. Learning this provided a clue that \"magical\" should be removed from the prompt if the goal was to create a stack of delicious donuts.\n\n\n\n\nThe /shorten command is a tool to help you explore how the Midjourney Bot interprets tokens and experiment with words, but it may not work for all subjects and styles of prompting.\n\n\n\n\nHow to Use Shorten\n\nUse the /shorten <your prompt> command in any Bot Channel to get information on your prompt\n\nPrevious\nRemix\nNext\nWorking with Your Own Images\nMidjourney is an independent research lab exploring new mediums of thought and expanding the imaginative powers of the human species.

Using a multi-prompt allows you to assign relative importance to the concept in the prompt, helping you control how they are blended together.\nMulti-Prompt Basics\n\nAdding a double colon :: to a prompt indicates to the Midjourney Bot that it should consider each part of the prompt individually. For the prompt space ship both words are considered together, and the Midjourney Bot produces images of sci-fi spaceships. If the prompt is separated into two parts, space:: ship, both concepts are considered separately, then blended together creating a sailing ship traveling through space.\n\n\n\nThere is no space between the double colons ::\nMulti-prompts work with Model Versions 1, 2, 3, 4, '5, niji, and niji 5\nAny parameters are still added to the very end of the prompt.\n\n\n\n\nspace ship\n\nspace ship is considered as a single thought.\n\nspace:: ship\n\nspace and ship are considered separate thoughts\n\ncheese cake painting\n\ncheese cake painting is considered together, producing a painted image of a cheesecake.\n\ncheese:: cake painting\n\ncheese is considered separately from cake painting, producing images of painted cakes made of cheeses.\n\ncheese:: cake:: painting\n\ncheese, cake, and painting are considered separately, producing tiered cakes, made of cheeses with common classical painting compositions and elements.\n\nPrompt Weights\n\nWhen a double colon :: is used to separate a prompt into different parts, you can add a number immediately after the double colon to assign the relative importance to that part of the prompt.\n\nIn the example below, the prompt space:: ship produced a sailing ship traveling through space. Changing the prompt to space::2 ship makes the word space twice as important as the word ship, producing images of space that have ships as a supporting element.\n\n[Model Versions] 1, 2, 3 only accept whole numbers as weights\n[Model Versions] 4, niji 4, niji 5, 5, 5.1, and 5.2 and can accept decimal places for weights\nNon-specified weights default to 1.\n\nspace:: ship\n\nspace and ship are considered as separate thoughts\n\nspace::2 ship\n\nspace is twice as important as ship\n\nWeights are normalized:\nspace:: ship is the same as space::1 ship, space:: ship::1,space::2 ship::2, space::100 ship::100, etc.\ncheese::2 cake is the same as cheese::4 cake::2, cheese::100 cake::50 etc.\ncheese:: cake:: painting is the same as cheese::1 cake::1 painting::1, cheese::1 cake:: painting::, cheese::2 cake::2 painting::2 etc.\n\n\n\n\nNegative Prompt Weights\n\nNegative weights can be added to parts of a multi-prompt to help remove unwanted elements.\nThe sum of all weights must be a positive number.\n\nstill life gouache painting\n\na range of objects appear in the still life\n\nstill life gouache painting:: fruit::-.5\n\nThe still life has fewer fruits\n\n\n\n\nThe --no Parameter\n\nThe --no parameter is the same as weighing part of a multi prompt to \"-.5\" vibrant tulip fields:: red::-.5 is the same as vibrant tulip fields --no red.\n\n\n\n\nPrevious\nImage Prompts\nNext\nRemix\nMidjourney is an independent research lab exploring new mediums of thought and expanding the imaginative powers of the human species.

The Midjourney Bot breaks down the words and phrases in a prompt into smaller pieces, called tokens, that can be compared to its training data and then used to generate an image. A well-crafted prompt can help make unique and exciting images.\nBasic Prompts\n\nA basic prompt can be as simple as a single word, phrase or emoji\n\n\n\n\nPrompting Tip!\n\nThe Midjourney Bot works best with simple, short sentences that describe what you want to see. Avoid long lists of requests. Instead of: Show me a picture of lots of blooming California poppies, make them bright, vibrant orange, and draw them in an illustrated style with colored pencils Try: Bright orange California poppies drawn with colored pencils\n\n\n\n\nAdvanced Prompts\n\nMore advanced prompts can include one or more image URLs, multiple text phrases, and one or more parameters\n\nImage Prompts\n\nImage URLs can be added to a prompt to influence the style and content of the finished result. Image URLs always go at the front of a prompt.\n\nRead more about Image Prompts\n\nPrompt Text\n\nThe text description of what image you want to generate. See below for prompting information and tips. Well-written prompts help generate amazing images.\n\nParameters\n\nParameters change how an image generates. Parameters can change aspect ratios, models, upscalers, and lots more. Parameters go at the end of the prompt.\n\nRead more about Parameters\n\n\n\n\nPrompting Notes\nPrompt Length\n\nPrompts can be very simple. Single words (or even an emoji!) will produce an image. Very short prompts will rely heavily on Midjourney’s default style, so a more descriptive prompt is better for a unique look. However, super-long prompts aren’t always better. Concentrate on the main concepts you want to create.\n\n\n\n\nGrammar\n\nThe Midjourney Bot does not understand grammar, sentence structure, or words like humans. Word choice also matters. More specific synonyms work better in many circumstances. Instead of big, try gigantic, enormous, or immense. Remove words when possible. Fewer words mean each word has a more powerful influence. Use commas, brackets, and hyphens to help organize your thoughts, but know the Midjourney Bot will not reliably interpret them. The Midjourney Bot does not consider capitalization.\n\nMidjourney Model Version 4 is slightly better than other models at interpreting traditional sentence structure.\n\n\n\n\nFocus on What you Want\n\nIt is better to describe what you want instead of what you don’t want. If you ask for a party with “no cake,” your image will probably include a cake. If you want to ensure an object is not in the final image, try advance prompting using the --no parameter.\n\n\n\n\nThink About What Details Matter\n\nAnything left unsaid may surprise you. Be as specific or vague as you want, but anything you leave out will be randomized. Being vague is a great way to get variety, but you may not get the specific details you want.\n\nTry to be clear about any context or details that are important to you. Think about:\n\nSubject: person, animal, character, location, object, etc.\nMedium: photo, painting, illustration, sculpture, doodle, tapestry, etc.\nEnvironment: indoors, outdoors, on the moon, in Narnia, underwater, the Emerald City, etc.\nLighting: soft, ambient, overcast, neon, studio lights, etc\nColor: vibrant, muted, bright, monochromatic, colorful, black and white, pastel, etc.\nMood: Sedate, calm, raucous, energetic, etc.\nComposition: Portrait, headshot, closeup, birds-eye view, etc.\n\n\n\n\nUse Collective Nouns\n\nPlural words leave a lot to chance. Try specific numbers. \"Three cats\" is more specific than \"cats.\" Collective nouns also work, “flock of birds” instead of \"birds.”\n\nPrevious\nWriting Prompts\nNext\nDescribe\nMidjourney is an independent research lab exploring new mediums of thought and expanding the imaginative powers of the human species.

Choose your favorite images, and you'll receive a unique code you can use to customize the look of future Jobs.\n\nShare your Style Tuner and Codes with others to share, explore, and experiment with different aesthetics.\n\n/tune and codes are only compatible with Midjourney Model Version 5.2\n/tune is only available while in Fast Mode.\n--style parameters created with the Style Tuner are compatible with --stylize values between 20–1000.\n\n\n\n\nHow to Use the Style Tuner\n1. Generate Your Custom Style Tuner\n\nCreate a Style Tuner page using the /tune command.\n\n\n\n\n2. Select Your Preferred Options\nStyle Directions: Choose the number of image pairs you want to see in your Style Tuner (16, 32, 64, or 128 pairs).\nDefault Mode: Select the style mode for your sample images (Default or Raw). If you typically do not use the --style raw parameter with your prompts, choose \"default.\"\n\nUse an Exisiting Style Tuner\n\nIf another user has previously generated a Style Tuner with your prompt, you will receive a link to that Tuner. Click the link to access the existing Style Tuner. Using a previously generated Style Tuner does not use your subscription's GPU minutes.\n\n\n\n\n3. Submit your Job\nClick the Submit button.\nConfirm your submission.\n\nYour Style Tuner generates a pair of images for each Style Direction. A Style Tuner with 16 directions will generate 32 images. A Style Tuner with 128 directions will generate 256 images. Generating these images uses your subscription's Fast GPU time.\n\n\n\n\n4. Open Your Custom Style Tuner\nWhen your Style Tuner is ready, the Midjourney Bot will send you a direct message with a link to your Tuner.\nClick the link to open your Style Tuner in your web browser.\n\nTry this Style Tuner: https://tuner.midjourney.com/ejYLCOY\n\n\n\n\n5. Select images\n\nYour Style Tuner will show rows of image pairs, each representing a distinct visual direction for your prompt. Click on the image you prefer in each pair. If you don't feel strongly about either image, leave the empty middle box selected.\n\n\n\n\n6. Copy Your Code\n\nThe Style Tuner generates a code you can add to your prompts with the --style <code> Parameter. Learn more about parameters.\n\nTo copy your prompt and Parameter\n\nFind your customized code at the bottom of the page.\nClick the Copy button to copy your original prompt and newly generated --style <code> parameter.\n\nYou can share your Style Tuner page with friends and generate new codes without using any additional GPU minutes!\n\n\n\n\n7. Generate an Image\nReturn to Discord\nUse the /imagine command and paste your copied prompt and --style <code> parameter into the prompt field.\nGenerate your image\n\n\n\n\n8. Use Additional Midjourney Tools\n\nTake your image further by using other Midjourney tools like Upscale, Pan, Zoom-Out, Remix, or Vary-Region.\n\n\n\n\n9. Experiment and Explore\nUse your style code with a new prompt:\n\nThe Style Tuner you create uses your initial prompt to create sample images and help you visualize the impact of your choices. However, the generated codes can be used with any prompt. Remember that styles and prompts always work together to generate an image, so a style code may not transfer as intended to other prompts.\n\nExperiment: Style codes and prompts interact in complex ways. A code may have a strong effect on one prompt and a subtle effect on a similar prompt. The images you choose in your Style Tuner can combine in unexpected and creative ways. Use style codes as a tool to explore new looks and visuals.\nGenerate more codes: You can return to your Style Tuner page at any time to change your selections and create new codes.\nShare style codes: You can share or use style codes created by friends. Check out the Midjourney style-tuner channel to share your codes and discover new styles!\nFind a Style Tuner page: Find the Style Tuner page for any style code by adding it to this URL: https://tuner.midjourney.com/code/StyleCodeHere.\n\n\n\n\n10. Save and Reuse Your Codes\nUse the /settings command and turn on 📌Sticky Style. Sticky Style will save the last --style parameter used in your personal suffix, so you don't have to repeat the code on future prompts. Change codes by using a new --style or unselecting 📌Sticky Style.\nUse custom options to store your favorite codes.\nOr, create your own Discord server to organize your images, prompts, image references, and Style Tuner codes.\n\n\n\n\nStyle Tune Examples\n\nprompt vibrant california poppies\nAll images were made by style created using this Style Tuner\n\n\n\n\nRandom Codes\n\nUse the --style random parameter to apply a random 32 base styles Style Tuner code to your prompt. You can also use --style random-16, --style random-64 or --style random-128 to use random results from other lengths of tuners.\n\n--random simulates Style Tuner code with random selections chosen for 75% of the image pairs. You can adjust this percentage by adding a number to the end of the --random parameter. For example, --style random-32-15 simulates a 32-pair tuner with 15% of the image pairs selected, --style random-128-80 simulates a 128-pair tuner with 80% of the image pairs selected.\n\n\n\n\nCombine Codes\n\nCombine multiple codes in one parameter with a hyphen, --style code1-code2.\nCombine multiple codes and style raw: --style raw-code1-code2\n\n\n\n\nStyle Tuner and --stylize\n\nThe --stylize parameter adjusts the influence of the --style parameter on your generated images. If you're not seeing the desired effect from your code, consider combining it with higher stylization values, like --stylize 250, or --stylize 500.\n\nComparison\n\nprompt vibrant California poppies --style fdeQ4zOX5jd --stylize 250\n\n--stylize 20\n\n--stylize 100 (default)\n\n--stylize 250\n\n--stylize 750\n\n\n\n\nStyle Raw\n\nCombine your custom style code with Midjourney Style Raw by using --style raw-<code>.\nExample: To use Style Raw and --style fjo5S8BgMoV use --style raw-fjo5S8BgMoV.\n\n\n\n\nStyle Tuner and Niji Model Version\n\nStyle Tuner codes created with the Midjourney Bot are not compatible with the Niji Model version accessed through the Midjourney Bot. To create a Style Tuner or Code for Niji Model version, join the Niji Discord community and interact with the Niji Bot in the same way you interact with the Midjourney Bot. Your Midjourney subscription gives you access to the Niji community and Bot.\n\n\n\n\nTechnical Details\n\n/tune is compatible with prompts that include the following:\n--aspect\n--chaos\n--tile\nmulti prompts\n\n/tune and style codes are not compatible with image prompts that do not include a text prompt.\n\n\n\nIf your /tune command does not return a clickable link, check that Embeds and Link Previews is enabled in your Discord App Settings\n\n\n\n\n\nPrevious\nUpscalers\nNext\nPan\nMidjourney is an independent research lab exploring new mediums of thought and expanding the imaginative powers of the human species.

Enable Remix Mode\n\nUse the /settings command and select 🎛️ Remix from the pop-up.\n\n2. Generate an Image\n\nCreate an image using the /imagine command.\n\n\n\n\n3. Upscale the Image\n\nUse the U buttons to upscale your selected image.\n\n\n\n\n4. Select Vary Region\n\nClick the 🖌️ Vary (Region) button to open the editing interface.\n\n\n\n\n5. Select Areas to Regenerate\nChoose the freehand or rectangular selection tools in the lower left of the Editor.\nSelect the areas of your image that you want to regenerate.\nThe size of your selection will affect your results. Larger selections give the Midjourney Bot more room to generate new creative details. Smaller selections will result in smaller, more subtle changes.\nNote: You cannot edit an existing selection but can undo multiple steps using the undo button in the upper right corner.\n\n\n\n\n6.

Larger selections provide the Midjourney Bot with more contextual information, which can improve the scaling and context of new additions. But selecting too much may lead to the newly generated elements blending or replacing parts of the original image you wished to preserve.\n\nPrompts Experiment with how you modify your prompt when Using Vary Region + Remix Mode. Prompts should focus on what you want to happen in the selected area. The Midjourney Bot also considers the existing image when generating a selected area, so shorter focused prompts often are more effective. Midjourney Prompts should not be conversational. Instead of \"Please change the meadow trail into a beautiful stream,\" be direct and prompt \"meadow stream.\"\n\nWork in Small Steps If you want to change many parts of an image, work on one part at a time.

An aspect ratio is the width-to-height ratio of an image.

The image could be 1000px × 1000px, or 1500px × 1500px, and the aspect ratio would still be 1:1. A computer screen might have a ratio of 16:10. The width is 1.6 times longer than the height. So the image could be 1600px × 1000px, 4000px × 2000px, 320px x 200px, etc.\n\nThe default aspect ratio is 1:1.\n--aspect must use whole numbers. Use 139:100 instead of 1.39:1.\nThe aspect ratio impacts the shape and composition of a generated image.\nSome aspect ratios may be slightly changed when upscaling.\n\nMax Aspect Ratios\n\nDifferent Midjourney Version Models have different maximum aspect ratios.\n\n\tVersion 5\tVersion 4\tniji 5\nRatios\tany*\t1:2 to 2:1\tany*\n\nThe --ar parameter will accept any aspect ratio from 1:1 (square) up to the maximum aspect ratio for each model.

With this command, you can optimize your prompt by focusing on essential terms.\n\n/shorten is not compatible with multi prompts or the --no parameter\n\nAnalyze a Prompt with /Shorten\n\nThe Midjourney bot analyzes your prompt by breaking it down into smaller units known as tokens. These tokens can be phrases, words, or even syllables. The Midjourney bot converts these tokens into a format it can understand. It uses them with the associations and patterns learned during its training to guide how your image is generated. Think of tokens as the building blocks that help the Midjourney bot make sense of the input and create the desired visual output.\n\nLong prompts with unnecessary words, lengthy descriptions, poetic phrases, or direct addressing of the bot (\"Please make me an image,\" \"Thank you for your help, Midjourney Bot!\") can lead to unexpected elements being added to your images.\n\nThe /shorten command can help you discover the most important words in your prompt and what words you can omit.\n\n\n\n\nShorten Command Example\n\nIf you want to create a pile of sprinkle covered donuts you might try the prompt:\nPlease create a whimsical majestic tower of donuts, intricately crafted and adorned with a mesmerizing array of colorful sprinkles. Bring this sugary masterpiece to life, ensuring every detail is rendered in stunning magical realism. Thank you!\n\nIf you use /shorten command with the above prompt the Midjourney Bot will return the following information:\n\nIMPORTANT TOKENS\nPlease create a whimsical majestic tower of donuts, intricately crafted and adorned with a mesmerizing array of colorful sprinkles. Bring this sugary masterpiece to life, ensuring every detail is rendered in stunning magical realism. Thank you!\n\nSHORTENED PROMPTS\n1️⃣ Please, majestic tower of donuts, crafted, array of colorful sprinkles, sugary masterpiece, rendered, magical realism\n\n2️⃣ Please, majestic tower of donuts, colorful sprinkles, sugary masterpiece, rendered, magical realism\n\n3️⃣ majestic tower of donuts, colorful sprinkles, sugary, magical realism\n\n4️⃣ majestic tower of donuts, colorful sprinkles, magical\n\n5️⃣ tower of donuts, sprinkles\n\nThe most Important tokens in your prompt are highlighted in bold, the least important are stikethroughed. You will also be given 5 possible shorter prompts based on this information.\n\n\n\nShortened Option 1️⃣ \n\nPlease, majestic tower of donuts, crafted, array of colorful sprinkles, sugary masterpiece, rendered, magical realism\n\nShortened Option 2️⃣ \n\nPlease, majestic tower of donuts, colorful sprinkles, sugary masterpiece, rendered, magical realism\n\nShortened Option 3️⃣ \n\nmajestic tower of donuts, colorful sprinkles, sugary, magical realism\n\nShortened Option 4️⃣ \n\nmajestic tower of donuts, colorful sprinkles, magical\n\nShortened Option 5️⃣ \n\ntower of donuts, sprinkles\n\n\n\nAnalyzing the Results\n\nThe shortest prompt, Option 5️⃣ : tower of donuts, sprinkles produced an image closest to the original goal. Many of the filler words like \"whimsical,\" \"mesmerizing,\" and \"masterpiece\" could be omitted. Learning that \"tower\" and \"magical\" were considered important tokens helps explain why some images were generated with fairytale castle elements. Learning this provided a clue that \"magical\" should be removed from the prompt if the goal was to create a stack of delicious donuts.\n\n\n\n\nThe /shorten command is a tool to help you explore how the Midjourney Bot interprets tokens and experiment with words, but it may not work for all subjects and styles of prompting.\n\n\n\n\nHow to Use Shorten\n\nUse the /shorten <your prompt> command in any Bot Channel to get information on your prompt\n\nPrevious\nShow Job\nNext\nParameter List\nMidjourney is an independent research lab exploring new mediums of thought and expanding the imaginative powers of the human species.

Parameters can change an image's Aspect Ratios, switch between Midjourney Model Versions, change which Upscaler is used, and lots more.\n\nParameters are always added to the end of a prompt. You can add multiple parameters to each prompt.\n\n\n\n\nUsing an Apple device?\n\nMany Apple devices automatically change double hyphens (--) to an em-dash (—). Midjourney accepts both!\n\nBasic Parameters\nAspect Ratios\n\n--aspect, or --ar Change the aspect ratio of a generation.\n\nChaos\n\n--chaos <number 0–100> Change how varied the results will be. Higher values produce more unusual and unexpected generations.\n\nFast\n\n--fast override your current setting and run a single job using Fast Mode.\n\nImage Weight\n\n--iw <0–2> Sets image prompt weight relative to text weight. The default value is 1.\n\nNo\n\n--no Negative prompting, --no plants would try to remove plants from the image.\n\nQuality\n\n--quality <.25, .5, or 1>, or --q <.25, .5, or 1> How much rendering quality time you want to spend. The default value is 1. Higher values use more GPU minutes; lower values use less.\n\nRandom\n\n--style random, add a random 32 base styles Style Tuner code to your prompt. You can also use --style random-16, --style random-64 or --style random-128 to use random results from other lengths of Style Tuners.\n\nRelax\n\n--relax override your current setting and run a single job using Relax Mode.\n\nRepeat\n\n--repeat <1–40>, or --r <1–40> Create multiple Jobs from a single prompt. --repeat is useful for quickly rerunning a job multiple times.\n\nSeed\n\n--seed <integer between 0–4294967295> The Midjourney bot uses a seed number to create a field of visual noise, like television static, as a starting point to generate the initial image grids. Seed numbers are generated randomly for each image but can be specified with the --seed or --sameseed parameter. Using the same seed number and prompt will produce similar ending images.\n\nStop\n\n--stop <integer between 10–100> Use the --stop parameter to finish a Job partway through the process. Stopping a Job at an earlier percentage can create blurrier, less detailed results.\n\nStyle\n\n--style <raw> Switch between versions of the Midjourney Model Version 5.1 and 5.2.\n--style <4a, 4b, or 4c> Switch between versions of the Midjourney Model Version 4.\n--style <cute, expressive, original, or scenic> Switch between versions of the Niji Model Version 5.\nUse the /tune command to create a Style Tuner and generate custom style codes.\n\nStylize\n\n--stylize <number>, or --s <number> parameter influences how strongly Midjourney's default aesthetic style is applied to Jobs.\n\nTile\n\n--tile parameter generates images that can be used as repeating tiles to create seamless patterns.\n\nTurbo\n\n--turbo override your current setting and run a single job using Turbo Mode.\n\nWeird\n\n--weird <number 0–3000>, or --w <number 0–3000> Explore unusual aesthetics with the experimental --weird parameter.\n\n\n\n\nDefault Values (Model Version 5.2)\n\tAspect Ratio\tChaos\tQuality\tSeed\tStop\tStylize\nDefault Value\n\t1:1\t0\t1\tRandom\t100\t100\nRange\n\tany\t0–100\t.25 .5, or 1\twhole numbers 0–4294967295\t10–100\t0–1000\nAspect ratios greater than 2:1 are experimental and may produce unpredictable results.\n\n\n\n\nDefault Values (Model Version 6)\n\tAspect Ratio\tChaos\tQuality\tSeed\tStop\tStylize\nDefault Value\n\t1:1\t0\t1\tRandom\t100\t100\nRange\n\t1:3–3:1\t0–100\t.25 .5 or 1\twhole numbers 0–4294967295\t10–100\t0–1000\n\n\n\n\nModel Version Parameters\n\nMidjourney routinely releases new model versions to improve efficiency, coherency, and quality.

The latest model is the default, but other models can be used by adding the --version or --v parameter or by using the /settings command and selecting a model version. Each model excels at producing different types of images.\n\n--version accepts the values 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 5.1, and 5.2\n--version can be abbreviated --v\n--v 5.2 is the current default model.\n\nModel Version 5.2\n\nThe Midjourney V5.2 model is the newest and most advanced, released June 2023. To use this model, add the --v 5.2 parameter to the end of a prompt, or use the /settings command and select 5️⃣ MJ Version 5.2\n\nDefault Model 06/22/23–current\n\nThis model produces more detailed, sharper results with better colors, contrast, and compositions.

Larger selections provide the Midjourney Bot with more contextual information, which can improve the scaling and context of new additions. But selecting too much may lead to the newly generated elements blending or replacing parts of the original image you wished to preserve.\n\nPrompts Experiment with how you modify your prompt when Using Vary Region + Remix Mode. Prompts should focus on what you want to happen in the selected area. The Midjourney Bot also considers the existing image when generating a selected area, so shorter focused prompts often are more effective. Midjourney Prompts should not be conversational. Instead of \"Please change the meadow trail into a beautiful stream,\" be direct and prompt \"meadow stream.\"\n\nWork in Small Steps If you want to change many parts of an image, work on one part at a time. This way, you can create a focused prompt for each part.\n\n\n\nVary Region + Remix Examples\n\nOriginal Image\n\nPrompt: gouache alligator in sunglasses\n\nSelection\n\nUpdated Prompt: gouache alligator in green sunglasses\n\nResult\n\nUpdated Prompt: gouache alligator in green sunglasses\n\n\n\n\nOriginal Image\n\nPrompt: scratchboard apple tree branch\n\nSelection\n\nUpdated Prompt: rainbow scratchboard apple tree branch\n\nResult\n\nUpdated Prompt: rainbow scratchboard apple tree branch\n\n\n\n\nTechnical Details\n\nJobs generated using Vary (Region) + Remix Mode will honor the following parameters:\n--chaos\n--fast\n--iw\n--no\n--stylize\n--relax\n--style\n--version\n--video\n--weird\n\nPrevious\nVary Region\nNext\nUpscalers\nMidjourney is an independent research lab exploring new mediums of thought and expanding the imaginative powers of the human species.

The Midjourney Bot breaks down the words and phrases in a prompt into smaller pieces, called tokens, that can be compared to its training data and then used to generate an image. A well-crafted prompt can help make unique and exciting images.\nBasic Prompts\n\nA basic prompt can be as simple as a single word, phrase or emoji\n\n\n\n\nPrompting Tip!\n\nThe Midjourney Bot works best with simple, short sentences that describe what you want to see. Avoid long lists of requests. Instead of: Show me a picture of lots of blooming California poppies, make them bright, vibrant orange, and draw them in an illustrated style with colored pencils Try: Bright orange California poppies drawn with colored pencils\n\n\n\n\nAdvanced Prompts\n\nMore advanced prompts can include one or more image URLs, multiple text phrases, and one or more parameters\n\nImage Prompts\n\nImage URLs can be added to a prompt to influence the style and content of the finished result. Image URLs always go at the front of a prompt.\n\nRead more about Image Prompts\n\nPrompt Text\n\nThe text description of what image you want to generate. See below for prompting information and tips. Well-written prompts help generate amazing images.\n\nParameters\n\nParameters change how an image generates. Parameters can change aspect ratios, models, upscalers, and lots more. Parameters go at the end of the prompt.\n\nRead more about Parameters\n\n\n\n\nPrompting Notes\nPrompt Length\n\nPrompts can be very simple. Single words (or even an emoji!) will produce an image. Very short prompts will rely heavily on Midjourney’s default style, so a more descriptive prompt is better for a unique look. However, super-long prompts aren’t always better. Concentrate on the main concepts you want to create.\n\n\n\n\nGrammar\n\nThe Midjourney Bot does not understand grammar, sentence structure, or words like humans. Word choice also matters. More specific synonyms work better in many circumstances. Instead of big, try gigantic, enormous, or immense. Remove words when possible. Fewer words mean each word has a more powerful influence. Use commas, brackets, and hyphens to help organize your thoughts, but know the Midjourney Bot will not reliably interpret them. The Midjourney Bot does not consider capitalization.\n\nMidjourney Model Version 4 is slightly better than other models at interpreting traditional sentence structure.\n\n\n\n\nFocus on What you Want\n\nIt is better to describe what you want instead of what you don’t want. If you ask for a party with “no cake,” your image will probably include a cake. If you want to ensure an object is not in the final image, try advance prompting using the --no parameter.\n\n\n\n\nThink About What Details Matter\n\nAnything left unsaid may surprise you. Be as specific or vague as you want, but anything you leave out will be randomized. Being vague is a great way to get variety, but you may not get the specific details you want.\n\nTry to be clear about any context or details that are important to you. Think about:\n\nSubject: person, animal, character, location, object, etc.\nMedium: photo, painting, illustration, sculpture, doodle, tapestry, etc.\nEnvironment: indoors, outdoors, on the moon, in Narnia, underwater, the Emerald City, etc.\nLighting: soft, ambient, overcast, neon, studio lights, etc\nColor: vibrant, muted, bright, monochromatic, colorful, black and white, pastel, etc.\nMood: Sedate, calm, raucous, energetic, etc.\nComposition: Portrait, headshot, closeup, birds-eye view, etc.\n\n\n\n\nUse Collective Nouns\n\nPlural words leave a lot to chance. Try specific numbers. \"Three cats\" is more specific than \"cats.\" Collective nouns also work, “flock of birds” instead of \"birds.”\n\nPrevious\nCommunity Guidelines\nNext\nExplore Prompting\nMidjourney is an independent research lab exploring new mediums of thought and expanding the imaginative powers of the human species.

To keep the platform accessible and welcoming to the broadest number of users, content must be PG-13.\nBe kind and respect each other and staff. Do not create images or use text prompts that are inherently disrespectful, aggressive, or otherwise abusive. Violence or harassment of any kind will not be tolerated.\nNo adult content or gore. Please avoid making visually shocking or disturbing content. We will block some text inputs automatically.\nDo not publicly repost the creations of others without their permission.\nBe careful about sharing. It’s OK to share your creations outside of the Midjourney community, but please consider how others might view your content.\nAny violations of these rules may lead to bans from our services. We are not a democracy. Behave respectfully or lose your rights to use the Service.\n\n\n\n\nThese rules apply to all content, including images made in private servers, using Private Mode, and in direct messages with the Midjourney Bot. See the Discord #rules channel for the most up-to-date information.\n\nNotes\nWhat is Considered Gore?\n\nGore includes images of detached body parts of humans or animals, cannibalism, blood, violence (images of shooting or bombing someone, for instance), deformed bodies, severed limbs, pestilence, etc.\n\nWhat's NSFW or Adult Content?\n\nAvoid nudity, sexual organs, fixation on naked breasts, people in showers or on toilets, sexual imagery, fetishes, etc.\n\nOther Offensive Content\n\nOther things may be deemed offensive or abusive because they can be viewed as racist, homophobic, disturbing, or in some way derogatory to a community. This includes offensive or inflamatory images of celebrities or public figures. Content guidelines are continually reviewed and may be modified as the Midjourney community grows.\n\nAbout the Community Standards\n\nFinding a balance between facilitating artistic expression and creating a safe and welcoming community for a broad group of users is challenging. Everyone has a right to an opinion about what images are beautiful, intriguing, or inspiring, and there are as many individual interpretations of what content is offensive, inappropriate, or harmful. We also recognize that art has a long history of pushing the status quo to challenge social conventions, inspire discussion, and spark change.\n\nWhen deciding on our community guidelines for Midjourney, we considered many factors. As a new and rapidly developing technology, it is important to consider how the broader public will perceive and be introduced to this technology. Midjourney is a more participatory image-making tool than a paintbrush or pencil. The Midjourney team does not wish to participate in creating pornographic, offensive, or harmful images. Most important, however, was our desire to create a welcoming and inclusive community for all users. To that end, we have established guidelines prohibiting certain behaviors and language on our platform.\n\nWe understand that the balance we decided on may not be popular with everyone. Still, we hope you will respect our efforts to create a positive and supportive community for all. We encourage you to express yourself creatively but to do so in a way that is respectful and considerate of others.\n\nUsers who repeatedly violate the terms of service may be warned by a community moderator, given a time-out from accessing the bot, or be blocked from the service.\n\nSelf-Policing and Reporting\n\nOccasionally prompts will unintentionally produce non-PG-13 content. Please self-police these images by using the ❌ emoji reaction or by right-clicking selecting Apps and then clicking Cancel Job to delete the image.\n\nUsers may flag any image for moderator review by right-clicking selecting Apps, and then clicking Report Job within Discord or the website by selecting ... under an image and clicking Report.\n\nReport Images in Discord\nReport Images on the Website\n\n\n\n\nAutomation\n\nIn order to maintain the highest quality experience for all users, Midjourney accounts are designed for individual use and each user may maintain only one account. Midjourney does not provide an API to access the bot through third-party apps or scripts, and automating interactions with the Midjourney Bot is strictly prohibited according to our Terms of Service. Accounts who do not comply with these rules may be blocked.\n\nPrevious\nQuick Start\nNext\nPrompts\nMidjourney is an independent research lab exploring new mediums of thought and expanding the imaginative powers of the human species.
